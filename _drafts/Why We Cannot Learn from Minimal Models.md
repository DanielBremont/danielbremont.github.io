Why We Cannot Learn from Minimal Models

Philosophers of science have developed several accounts of how
consideration of scientific models can prompt learning about real-world targets. In
recent years, various authors advocated the thesis that consideration of so-called
minimal models can prompt learning about such targets. In this paper, I draw on the
philosophical literature on scientific modelling and on widely cited illustrations
from economics and biology to argue that this thesis fails to withstand scrutiny.
More specifically, I criticize leading proponents of such thesis for failing to
explicate in virtue of what properties or features minimal models supposedly prompt
learning and for substantially overstating the epistemic import of minimal models. I
then examine and refute several arguments one may put forward to demonstrate that
consideration of minimal models can prompt learning about real-world targets. In
doing so, I illustrate the implications of my critique for the wider debate on the
epistemology of scientific modelling.
