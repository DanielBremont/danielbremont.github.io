Models in Physics

The object of the present paper is to consider the role of models in modern
theoretical physics. We want to discuss the circumstances in which models
arise and the uses to which they are put, comprising in brief summary the
probing of theories, the discovery of new theories and the empirical testing
of theories. In the first place we want to describe the way the term model
is actually used by physicists and in particular how it is related to the idea
of approximation. We shall then want to expose as clearly as possible the
logical structure of the arguments used by physicists when they employ
models for various different purposes. We shall be at pains to point out
the logical gaps in these arguments and thereby to provide a critique of
some vital aspects of modern physics. Some of the very extensive literature
on models in science1
 has been concerned with attempting to justify the
heuristic role of models in producing predictive theories in the sense of
theories which are devised to explain or comprehend one group of
phenomena and succeed in giving successful predictions about some other
quite different phenomena. This involves typically a realist approach to
theories combined with a technical 'logic' of analogy.2
 The sense of
analogy employed in these arguments is described in section 3 below However, it does not appear to play a centra! role in modern theoretical
physics. Furthermore the role of analogy in characterising satisfactory
explanations as ones which relate the unknown or less familiar to the
known or familiar1
 is no longer conspicuous. Now, while admitting
the importance and interest of such general questions as 'How is
predictive science possible?' or 'What characterises a satisfactory
explanation in science?', we want to claim as a legitimate activity for
philosophy of science the humbler activity of describing what is actually
done by scientists, with a view of course to discussing whether what is
done is in fact justifiable on any acceptable canons of deductive or
inductive logic. If the practice of science involves an irreducibly intuitive
element we want to pin down and locate such elements as accurately as
possible in the general structure of scientific activity.
We shall be concerned with theoretical models2
