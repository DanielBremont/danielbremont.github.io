Recent accounts of scientific method suggest that a model, or analogy, for an
axiomatized theory is another theory, or postulate set, with an identical calculus. The
present paper examines five central theses underlying this position. In the light of
examples from physical science it seems necessary to distinguish between models and
analogies and to recognize the need for important revisions in the position under study,
especially in claims involving an emphasis on logical structure and similarity in form
between theory and analogy. While formal considerations are often relevant in the
employment of an analogy they are neither as extensive as proponents of this viewpoint
suggest, nor are they in most cases sufficient for allowing analogies to fulfill the roles
imputed to them. Of major importance, and what these authors generally fail to
consider, are physical similarities between analogue and theoretical object. Such
similarities, which are characteristic in varying degrees of most analogies actually
employed, play an important role in affording a better understanding of concepts in
the theory and also in the development of the theoretical assumptions.
