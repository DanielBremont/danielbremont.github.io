## Modelar el valor que aprender *x* o hacer *y* me puede traer

- Antes de agregar conocimiento al blog verificar como encaja con los otros conocimientos, con las cosas practicas de mi vida, "si compone", si puedo explorarlo, replicarlo.
- Me permite mejorar las cosas que hago.
- Los problemas que estoy intentando resolver.
- Proyectos que esoy intentado hacer.
- Most gains for the least amount of time.
- Fruta larga colgando
- Marginal gains
- Core skills vs tools for do tasks. (I want to undertand text computationaly, so i use a library to transcribe audio to text), and understand the text, but i don't care how to go from video to text.
- Can i learn or do x?
- Can i gain from this even if i fail?

## First principles

[More](https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/)

Do you need an innovative solution to a complex problem? Try approaching the problem from first principles.

To do this, take your problem and:

1. Break it down into its fundamental parts
2. Reconfigure those parts to build a solution

## Inversion

[More](https://jamesclear.com/inversion)

Are you solving for only the best-case scenario? Try inversion to get a 360-degree view of your problem. To do this, instead of thinking of ideal solutions, think of bad solutions then ask yourself, “How might we avoid these?”

This method is great in situations when you want to approach a problem from an alternative point of view, or when you want to make sure you avoid worst-case scenarios.

## Abstraction laddering

Want to make sure you see the forest for the trees? Try abstraction laddering to get above your problem.

- Start with your original problem statement: Design a better can opener
- Then ask “how” questions to get to more concrete statements. How might we design a better can opener? → Make it more appealing. Paint it red and add a bow!
- You can also ask “why” questions to get more abstract statements. Why might someone need a can opener? → To get soup out of a can
- Now ask “how” from a higher level How might we design a better way to get soup out of a can → We could redesign the top of the can itself to be a pop top

### Models for communicating

## The diamond model

![Diamong Model](/public/images/diamond_model.png "Diamong Model")

Are you preparing long-form content (like presentations or big docs)? The diamond model works great for putting a structure around your main idea.

1. Attention: Start with a story, statistic, or something similar
2. Main topic: Briefly introduce the main topic you’ll cover
3. Previews: Give quick previews of your subtopics
4. Subtopics: Go into depth with your subtopics
5. Summaries: Recap your subtopics
6. Conclusion: Paint an ideal vision of the future
7. Call to action: Invite your audience to act or make a decision.
