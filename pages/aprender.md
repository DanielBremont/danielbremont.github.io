**Focus ‚Äúlearning time‚Äù on things that compound:**

- Compounding is a pretty important concept that shows up in compound interest, in Moore‚Äôs Law, all over the place. It‚Äôs about virtuous cycles. And so in the limited flexible time that I have, I think the rule of thumb is to focus on things that could trigger a virtuous cycle.

- One perfect place to start is becoming a faster typer. Getting faster allows me to write more, to communicate more, to get more done in the same amount of time, because it makes almost everything I do on the computer faster.

- Building lasting relationships is also a compounding activity because it gives you access to more people who can help you get things done more quickly.

- Learning the  fundamentals computer scinece, maths, stats deeply.

- Learning your tools, vs code etc.

- Consuming (books, papers, blogs, courses, whatever) is not inherently a compounding thing. Only if you have some kind of method to reflect, to digest, to incorporate your knowledge into your thoughts.

What is Design Thinking?

*Basically*:

- research,
- hypothesize,
- prototype,
- test,
- iterate,
- deliver.
- It's not new, but here we are with new terminology.

Design Thinking is just solving problems (and creating new solutions) from the end-user's perspective.

- Excitement starts something. Execution completes it.
- Excitement feels good. Action is good.

**OAuth (Access Token) Vs API Key**:

- You need OAuth only when you want to enable a user of your service to allow a third-party client application to access his/her data hosted in your service without revealing his/her credentials (ID & password) to the application.

- What a pair of API key & API secret can do is just authentication of a client application. If it is okay for you to allow an authenticated client application to access a user's data without explicit consent by the user, you don't have to use OAuth.
