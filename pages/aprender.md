**Focus “learning time” on things that compound:**
 
- Compounding is a pretty important concept that shows up in compound interest, in Moore’s Law, all over the place. It’s about virtuous cycles. And so in the limited flexible time that I have, I think the rule of thumb is to focus on things that could trigger a virtuous cycle.

- One perfect place to start is becoming a faster typer. Getting faster allows me to write more, to communicate more, to get more done in the same amount of time, because it makes almost everything I do on the computer faster.

- Building lasting relationships is also a compounding activity because it gives you access to more people who can help you get things done more quickly.

- Consuming (books, papers, blogs, courses, whatever) is not inherently a compounding thing. Only if you have some kind of method to reflect, to digest, to incorporate your knowledge into your thoughts.

- **Do you feel a Ph.D. or Masters level of expertise is necessary or one can contribute to the field of Deep Learning without being an “expert”?**
    Plenty of significant contributors in the field of deep learning today don’t have a Ph.D. To contribute meaningfully to a field, whether with systems development or with novel research, you absolutely do need to have a certain level of expertise. But you can gain expertise without going through a Ph.D. program, obviously, and having a Ph.D. is not actually a guarantee that you’ve developed meaningful expertise in anything — in theory it should, but as far as I can tell, reality doesn’t align very well with that theory. In fact, unless you aim at becoming an academic, I don’t think getting a Ph.D. is the best path to gaining expertise. The best path is a path that gets you to grow fast, open-endedly. And you will learn the fastest by working on a large variety of projects in situations of teamwork and close mentorship from experts. In practice, the typical Ph.D. program looks nothing like that.
    
    Avoid doing any work on anything that's not circled.

- **Skill Compensation**: People who are exceptionally good at one thing tend to be exceptionally poor at another.

- **Curse of Knowledge**: The inability to communicate your ideas because you wrongly assume others have the necessary background to understand what you’re talking about.

- **Base Rates**: The success rate of everyone who’s done what you’re about to try.

- **Pareto Principle**: The majority of outcomes are driven by a minority of events.

- **Sturgeon’s Law**: “90% of everything is crap.” The obvious inverse of the Pareto Principle, but hard to accept in practice.

- **Cumulative advantage**: Social status snowballs in either direction because people like associating with successful people, so doors are opened for them, and avoid associating with unsuccessful people, for whom doors are closed.

- **Impostor Syndrome**: Fear of being exposed as less talented than people think you are, often because talent is owed to cumulative advantage rather than actual effort or skill.

- **McNamara Fallacy**: A belief that rational decisions can be made with quantitative measures alone, when in fact the things you can’t measure are often the most consequential. Named after Defense Secretary McNamara, who [tried to quantify](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/immeasurably-important/) every aspect of the Vietnam War.

- **Berkson’s Paradox**: Strong correlations can fall apart when combined with a larger population. Among hospital patients, motorcycle crash victims wearing helmets are more likely to be seriously injured than those not wearing helmets. But that’s because most crash victims saved by helmets did not need to become hospital patients, and those without helmets are more likely to die before becoming a hospital patient.

- **Ludic Fallacy**: Falsely associated simulations with real life. Nassim Taleb: “Organized competitive fighting trains the athlete to focus on the game and, in order not to dissipate his concentration, to ignore the possibility of what is not specifically allowed by the rules, such as kicks to the groin, a surprise knife, et cetera. So those who win the gold medal might be precisely those who will be most vulnerable in real life.”

- **Actor-Observer Asymmetry**: We judge others based solely on their actions, but when judging ourselves we have an internal dialogue that justifies our mistakes and bad decisions.

- **Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy**: Goals set retroactively after an activity, like shooting a blank wall and then drawing a bullseye around the holes you left, or picking a benchmark after you’ve invested.

- **Golem Effect**: Performance declines when supervisors/teachers have low expectations of your abilities.

- **Behavioral Inevitability**: “History never repeats itself; man always does.” – Voltaire

- **Apophenia**: A tendency to perceive correlations between unrelated things, because your mind can only deal with tiny sample sizes and assuming things are correlated creates easy/comforting explanations of how the world works.

- **Hanlon’s Razor**: “Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.”

- **Cobra Effect**: Attempting to solve a problem makes that problem worse. Comes from an Indian story about a city infested with snakes offering a bounty for every dead cobra, which caused entrepreneurs to start breeding cobras for slaughter.

- **Non-Ergodic**: When group probabilities don’t apply to singular events. If 100 people play Russian Roulette once, the odds of dying might be, say, 10%. But if one person plays Russian Roulette 100 times, the odds are dying are practically 100%.

- **Pollyanna Principle**: It’s easier to remember happy memories than bad ones.

- **Declinism**: Perpetually viewing society as in decline, because you’re afflicted by the Pollyanna Principle and you forget how much things sucked in the past.

- **Collective Narcissism**: Exaggerating the importance and influence of your social group (country, industry, company, department, etc.).

- **Feedback Loops**: Falling stock prices scare people, which cause them to sell, which makes prices fall, which scares more people, which causes more people to sell, and so on. Works both ways.

- **Hawthorne Effect**: Being watched/studied changes how people behave, making it difficult to conduct social studies that accurately reflect the real world.

- **Hormesis**: Something that hurts you in a high dose can be good for you in small doses. (Weight on your bones, drinking red wine, etc.)

- **Reflexivity**: When cause and effect are the same. People think Tesla will sell a lot of cars, so Tesla stock goes up, which lets Tesla raise a bunch of new capital, which helps Tesla sell a lot of cars.

- **Friendship Paradox**: On average, people have fewer friends than their friends have. Occurs because people with an abnormally high number of friends are more likely to be one of your friends. It’s a fundamental part of social network dynamics and makes most people feel less popular than they are.

- **Bizarreness Effect**: Crazy things are easier to remember than common things, providing a distorted sense of “normal.”

- **Nonlinearity**: Outputs aren’t always proportional to inputs, so the world is a barrage of massive wins and horrible losses that surprise people.

- **Denomination Effect**: One hundred $1 bills feels like less money than one $100 bill. Also explains stock splits – buying 10 shares for $10 each feels cheaper than one share for $100.

- **Woozle Effect**: “A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth.” - Daniel Kahneman

- **Google Scholar Effect**: Scientific research depends on citing other research, and the research that gets cited the most is whatever shows up in the top results of Google Scholar searches, regardless of its contribution to the field.

- **Inversion**: Avoiding problems can be more important than scoring wins.

- **Dunning-Kruger Effect**: Knowing the limits of your intelligence requires a certain level of intelligence, so some people are too stupid to know how stupid they are.

- **Focusing Effect**: Overemphasizing factors that seem important but exist as part of a complex system. People from the Midwest assume Californians are happier because the weather is better, but they’re not because Californians also deal with traffic, bad bosses, unhappy marriages, etc, which more than offset the happiness boost from sunny skies.

- **Founder’s Syndrome**: When a CEO is so emotionally invested in a company that they can’t effectively delegate decisions.

- **Bounded Rationality**: People can’t be fully rational because your brain is a hormone machine, not an Excel spreadsheet.

- **Luxury Paradox**: The more expensive something is the less likelys you are to use it, so the relationship between price and utility is an inverted U. Ferraris sit in garages; Hondas get driven.

- **Meat Paradox**: Dogs are family, pigs are food. Some animals classified as food are wrongly perceived to have lower intelligence than those classified as pets. An example of morality depending on utility.

- **Fluency Heuristic**: Ideas that can be explained simply are more likely to be believed than those that are complex, even if the simple-sounding ideas are nonsense. It occurs because ideas that are easy to grasp are hard to distinguish from ideas you’re familiar with.

- **Goodhart's law**: [Ir youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwcK7NI_i98&feature=emb_logo){:target="_blank"}
    - When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.
    - Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.

- **Learn the Math**

What does it mean to multiply two matrices together? What is a determinant? What is a matrix decomposition? What is a matrix? What is a vector?

You might have noticed but data is usually stored as arrays in a computer and matrices/vectors have a lot of tricks you can do.

Basic statistics. How does something like PCA work? What is an eigenvector?

Then comes calculus. How does a neural network learn? How does optimization work?

I am not talking about the big picture. I am talking about grabbing a pen and paper and going through it step-by-step and computing things by hand.

And most importantly, how do you learn and understand these things without a step-by-step tutorial where they hold your hand? Because there usually isn't a step-by-step tutorial.

Those intimidating looking equations don't contain anything you can't learn by taking linear algebra 1,2, calc 1,2,3, vector calc and perhaps differential equations. That's a minor in math or so, pretty much what every physicist, engineer etc. goes through.

That's it. The rest is applications of that fundamental knowledge. If you "learn the math" then you can pick up a book or a research paper and work through it yourself.

Just like for a kindergardener 56*45 looks like super advanced math they couldn't possibly comprehend and a keras tutorial looks like alien language to a college freshman that hasn't programmed before, fundamental math looks like "intimidating equations" while in reality they are the equivalent of some pseudocode.

Learn the math and all of these problems you're having are going to go away. Just like learning programming isn't about watching a lecture, learning math isn't about watching a lecture or reading a book either. Go get paper and a pen (or preferably an ipad and pencil, best thing ever) and go do some university courses. Do the 20 weekly exercises they assign you that take 10-12 hours to complete. At the end (~5 courses so I guess 1 year of a few hours a week) you're going to read the math in papers like you read the pseudocode in the papers.

Doing machine learning without having the fundamental math background is like doing machine learning without knowing how to code. Despite what the "participate in kaggle with no code!" advertisement insists upon my iphone whenever I open reddit, trying to do ML without knowing how to code is a bad idea.
