*Semana 1*

## Lunes

1. (IC 1.2.3) How many sequences are there of n digits in which no two consecutive digits are the same?

2. (IC 1.4.5) A bag contains 50 red balls and 50 blue balls. Ten balls are drawn at random from the bag. What is the probability that this sample will contain five red balls and five blue balls?

## Martes

1. (AOPSV1 56) Given $$\frac{x}{y} = \frac{2}{3}$$ and $$\frac{y}{z} = \frac{3}{2}$$, find $$\frac{x}{z}$$

2. (AOPSV1 82) If $$p$$ is $$50\%$$ of $$q$$ and $$r$$ is $$40\%$$ of $$q$$, what percent of $$r$$ is $$p$$?

## Miercoles

1. (AOPSV2 84) Find the remainder when $$x^{13} +1$$ is divided by $$x-1$$.

2. (AOPSV2 95) Lets $$r, s,$$ and $$t$$ be the roots of $$x^3 - 6x^2 + 5x - 7 = 0$$. Find $$\frac{1}{r^2} + \frac{1}{s^2} + \frac{1}{t^2}$$

## Jueves

1. (AOPSV2 307) There are $$4$$ black marbles and $$2$$ white marbles in bag $$A$$. In bag $$B$$, there are $$3$$ black and $$5$$ white marbles. A bag is randomly chosen and a marble is chosen from the bag.  The marble is black;  What is the probability that i came from bag $$A$$?

## Viernes

1. [Ir Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/practice/functions-level-5-challenges/?p=1) Let $$f(x)$$ be a cubic polynomial such that $$f(1) = 5, f(2) = 20, f(3) = 45f(1)=5,f(2)=20,f(3)=45$$.

    Then find the product of roots of the equation below.
        $$[f(x)]^{2} + 3x \ f(x) + 2x^{2} = 0$$.
