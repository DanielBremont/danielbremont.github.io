<h2 class="nocount">How to study with online courses?</h2>

<p>Online courses are not a panacea. When you take a university course, you have:</p>

<ul>
<li>2-3 hours a week of lectures</li>
<li>1-2 hours a week of seminars</li>
<li>1-2 hours a week of office hours</li>
<li>exercises</li>
<li>homework</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that online courses don&rsquo;t provide seminars and office hours, which are frequently even more important than the lectures themselves! When I try to self-study anything I get stuck on material <em>all the time</em> and when I took Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statistics, etc. in the university I visited office hours almost religiously.</p>

<p>What is the alternative to office hours and seminars? It seems that the only viable alternatives are</p>

<ul>
<li>a private tutor</li>
<li>a friendly professor at a local university</li>
<li>a friend whom it would not be too awkward to pester with questions</li>
</ul>

<p>None of these are perfect.</p>
