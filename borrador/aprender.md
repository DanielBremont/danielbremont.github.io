**Focus ‚Äúlearning time‚Äù on things that compound:**

- Compounding is a pretty important concept that shows up in compound interest, in Moore‚Äôs Law, all over the place. It‚Äôs about virtuous cycles. And so in the limited flexible time that I have, I think the rule of thumb is to focus on things that could trigger a virtuous cycle.

- One perfect place to start is becoming a faster typer. Getting faster allows me to write more, to communicate more, to get more done in the same amount of time, because it makes almost everything I do on the computer faster.

- Building lasting relationships is also a compounding activity because it gives you access to more people who can help you get things done more quickly.

- Learning the  fundamentals computer scinece, maths, stats deeply.

- Learning your tools, vs code etc.

- Consuming (books, papers, blogs, courses, whatever) is not inherently a compounding thing. Only if you have some kind of method to reflect, to digest, to incorporate your knowledge into your thoughts.
