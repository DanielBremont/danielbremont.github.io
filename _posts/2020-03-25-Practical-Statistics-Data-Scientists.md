<!--Resumen-->
This book is aimed at the data scientis with some familiarity with R programming language, and with some prior (perhaps spotty or ephemeral) exposure to statistics. Both of us came to the world of data science from the world of statistics, so we have some appreciation of the contribution that statistics can make to the art of data science. At the time, we are well aware of the limitations of traditional statistics instrutions: statistics as a discipline is a century and a half old, and most statistics textbooks and courses are laden with the momentum and inertia of an ocean liner.

The goals underlie this book:
- To lay out, in digestible, navigable, and easily referenced from, key concepts from statistics that relevant to data science.
- That explain which concepts are important and useful from a data science perspective, which are less so, and why.
