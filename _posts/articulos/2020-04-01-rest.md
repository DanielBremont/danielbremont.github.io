## browser as editor

## a web for shared document editing

**Tim Berners Lee’s web**
- distributed document editing
- like one big Wiki 

**HTTP methods**
- GET: get a document from a server
- POST: send a document to a server
- PUT: update a document at a server
- DELETE: delete a document from a server 

**request components**
- query string: for searching
- body: for new version of page 


## what happened?

**early browsers**
- just displayed pages
- only needed GET

**Mosaic**
- added forms

**to pass form data**
- GET: in query string
- POST: in body

## URLs in the late 1990s

`http://uptontea.com/shopcart/toc.asp?parent=Teas&child=Green`

- `shopcart/toc.asp` script
- `parent=Teas&child=Green` arguments

**so now rather than**
- `DELETE pages/3`

**we see**
- `POST /deletePage`
- `GET /deletePage?id=3`

**or**
- `GET /foo.asp?action=delete&page=3`

**REST**


## 4 functions of persistent storage

|CRUD|SQL|HTTP|
create|insert|POST
read|select|GET
update|update|PUT
delete|delete|DELETE

## RESTful calls

`GET http://tea.com/teas/123/reviews/4`
- `GET` HTTP verb gives the action
- `http://tea.com/teas/123/reviews/4` path names a resource

## kinds of path

**collection paths**
- `http://tea.com/teas`
- `http://tea.com/teas/123/reviews`
- `http://tea.com/teas/green`

**instance paths**
- `http://tea.com/teas/123`
- `http://tea.com/teas/123/reviews/4 `

## actions

**show reviews of tea #123**
- `GET http://tea.com/teas/123/reviews`

**create a review of tea #123**
- `POST http://tea.com/teas/123/reviews`

**update review #4 of tea #123**
- `PUT http://tea.com/teas/123/reviews/4`

**delete review #4 of tea #123**
- `DELETE http://tea.com/teas/123/reviews/4`

## generating forms

**creating a review
- step 1: display form to user
- step 2: user submits form

**how this is done**
- `GET http://tea.com/teas/123/reviews/new`
- `POST http://tea.com/teas/123/reviews`

**and for update**
- `GET http://tea.com/teas/123/reviews/4/edit`
- `PUT http://tea.com/teas/123/reviews/4`

## non-CRUD actions

**general strategy**
- instead of calling an action, create a resource
- instead of “login”, create a “session”
- instead of “closing account”, create a “closing”

**how to rate a review?**
- `POST http://tea.com/teas/123/reviews/4/ratings`s
 

## loggin in and out
 
|option A|option B|option C|
/login|`POST /sessions`|`POST /session`
/logout|`DELETE /sessions/12`|`DELETE /session`

**what I’d do**
- whatever your login/authentication plugin does
- more important to have session in model than
to reflect in URIs 

## Authentication, Autorization, OAuth

**API keys** are public, by intent. They are an authorisation mechanism, not an authentication mechanism (this is mentioned in your links). It does not matter how they are generated but it matters how they are handled. In other words: "anyone with this key can enter".

So, you use API keys when you want to authorise and do not need to authenticate. You use **authentication tokens**, which are secured in handling, to authenticate the connection. In other words, "here is your unique key to allow you to enter this time".

You need **OAuth** only when you want to enable a user of your service to allow a third-party client application to access his/her data hosted in your service without revealing his/her credentials (ID & password) to the application.

What a pair of API key & API secrets can do is just authentication of a client application. If it is okay for you to allow an authenticated client application to access a user's data without explicit consent by the user, you don't have to use **OAuth**.
