# Breaking into AI: A Steady Diet of Courses, Competitions, and Papers

[Ir](https://www.deeplearning.ai/blog/breaking-into-ai-a-steady-diet-of-courses-competitions-and-papers/){:target="_blank"}

Daniel quit his job as a web developer and embarked on a journey of courses, Kaggle competitions, and research papers to break into AI. Read about Daniel’s advice for getting started and how he structured his own learning plan.

## Introduce yourself: What’s your background? Why did you decide to take the Deep Learning Specialization?

I was a web developer for a bit over eight years, working on different projects throughout university and then full-time. While I was advancing, I wanted to do something more challenging. I was at a point in my life where I could either start learning something new or continue on like before. I decided to quit my day job and invest in my education, though I didn’t know exactly what I would study. Initially I wanted to transition to more conventional software engineering because I had a background in algorithm design.  After a month of researching what I should specialize in, I found out about the big advancements happening in artificial intelligence. Searching for more information, I stumbled upon the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). I wasn’t sure how far I’d go, but after taking the first course in the Specialization, I was completely hooked. For the next 7 months, I ate courses for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 

## That’s a big decision! Did you take any other courses? 

I finished the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) but felt like I had just scraped the surface. I got an internship as a Machine Learning Engineer for a couple months, but decided to go back to learning so I could work on bigger projects. I decided to try the [Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning) next. I’d understood the logic behind the foundational ML concepts, but I didn’t really understand much of the math. This Specialization was a lot more challenging, but it was worth it. I started reading research papers and actually understanding them! I also took the [Stanford Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) and the [Big Data Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/big-data). 


## Besides courses, what else did you do as part of your learning plan?

I participated in a few Kaggle competitions to gain experience working on big and state-of-the-art problems. Even though I didn’t get a good rank, I learned so much by implementing all the knowledge learned in the courses and seeing all the concepts come together. During the first competition, I stopped and realized “Hey, I actually know what to do. I don’t have to search for it on Stack Overflow. Sure, I need to research and experiment, but I actually learned this already and I can do it.” I would advise any beginner to try a few competitions like this. You learn so much about how to put in practice what you’ve learned and how to go through the many and complex steps of an ML project. The best part is that you’re not alone, you’re part of an entire community doing the challenge alongside you and sharing their findings and ideas. While I was doing these competitions, I made a goal to read at least one research paper per day. I found a pretty good deep learning papers roadmap that went chronologically through the main papers from the main ML categories. Here’s the [link](https://github.com/floodsung/Deep-Learning-Papers-Reading-Roadmap). The list was very good when I started a year ago, but things evolve rapidly in this field, so I would suggest supplementing this list with main papers from the missing years (2018-2019).

## How did you transition from studying to your current ML job?

While I was still in the middle of learning, I was approached by a startup that wanted to build an NLP-powered chatbot that interviews people. At the time, I was more interested in computer vision. But I began to like the NLP area while working on the chatbot. I decided to specialize more in NLP and am now working full-time at the startup as the first ML engineer. Soon we’ll start increasing the company size and constructing a team to tackle this challenging but extremely fun mission.

## What was the hardest part about learning ML? And how did you overcome that obstacle?

Besides being called a crazy person, cutting my salary in half, and working without any guarantee of success? Even with all these concerns on my mind, it was keeping up the momentum, finding the motivation to do a little bit of a course every day that was hardest. Somehow I managed to do it, partially because I was genuinely enjoying what I was learning, and partly because the courses were extremely well organized. It was kind of like a college class, but more in-depth and with the freedom to learn at my own pace.

## What advice would you give to a learner who is just starting out?

Learning ML may be a lengthy process. (There’s a reason why the courses are organized in weeks.) Make a roadmap with things you want to learn, courses you want to take, and projects you want to try. Then just start. The original roadmap will probably change a lot after a few months, but having an overarching plan in mind will help you.  Spend time to really understand the foundational concepts. Do a course again, or read about the same concept multiple times from different sources. It may be boring at times, but you’ll already be a better practitioner then some people with 3-4 years of experience in the field. Search for advice from the best in the field. In the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), the Heroes of Deep Learning interviews at the end of the week had some of the best people from the Deep Learning community. I found the advice given there extremely valuable.

## How do you keep up on the latest AI news and breakthroughs? 

I subscribe to a dozen AI newsletters ([Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/), [Import AI](https://jack-clark.net/), Medium and [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/)) and try to read any interesting story I get from them. I’m also still doing my one-paper-per-day challenge. It’s the best way to understand the state of the art, and it also helps me find new areas to research. I also plan to attend the next ACL annual meeting or another similar conference. I think it’s the best place to gather news and knowledge about the state of the art of the field.  

## What do you envision as the next step for you? Where would you like to end up?

I’m still figuring out my next step. Having seen an overview of the field I realize that I still have so much to learn, so while I’m working on my current projects I still plan to further my knowledge for the time being. Ideally, I would love to research and help move forward the state of the art in NLP. Eventually, I’d like to make my own contribution to the field and become, dare I say, an expert.

## Anything else you’d like to share?

Machine learning is new and cool, and there’s a lot of companies looking for ML engineers. While learning ML is a great way to change your career, the end goal should be about improving your skills and finding out whether ML makes you excited and joyful. Focus on learning, and the job will follow naturally.  I’d like to thank all the instructors on Coursera for creating great educational content. Also, I’d especially like to thank Andrew Ng for his extremely insightful courses and all the work he’s done for the community.


# ML Career Advice And Reading Papers

[Ir](https://deeps.site/blog/2019/10/14/reading-research-papers-career-advice/){:target="blank"}

## How to master a new body of literature

Let’s say there’s an area you want to become good at like speech recognition or Text summarization or building a chat-bot.
Firstly,
    - compile a list of papers (from arxiv +medium, blog posts)
    - skip around the list that was compiled.

Lets say we want to master the domain of speech recognition systems.
    - We start of with 5 papers
    - we read 10% of all papers
    - quickly skim through and understand these papers
    - based on that let’s say we decide, paper number 2 is dud and it doesn’t make sense
    - further we decide paper 3 is a really seminal one, so we put a lot of time to read and understand that.
    - Keep adding the papers that are cited to the reading list in order to understand the best paper from them.
    - read the set of papers

![Resarch Advice](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soulbliss/for-hosting/master/images/research-advice/1.png "Resarch Advice")

## Rough guidelines on the number of papers to read

If we read 5-20 papers
    - we have a basic understanding of an area.
    - be able to do some work, apply algorithms .
    - not enough to do research or be at the cutting edge .

If we read 50-100 papers in an area
    - gives us a solid understanding of an area.
    - helpful to do cutting edge research.

## How to read any Research paper:

> "If we knew what we were doing it wouldn't be called research" <br/>
> Albert Einstein

A **bad way** to read a paper is to **go from the first word to the last word**.
**Take multiple passes at the paper.**

1. Here’s how Andrew Approaches to read a paper.
2. Read title/abstract/figures (first pass)
3. Intro + Conclusion + figures + skim the rest (skip related works)
4. Read the paper but skip the math.
5. Read the whole thing but skip parts that don’t make sense

## Some questions to keep in mind.

1. What did the authors try to accomplish?
2. What were the key elements of the approach?
3. What can you use yourself ?
4. What other references do you want to follow?

## Sources of New papers?

- Twitter
- [Machine Learning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/)
- Follow 
    - [NIPS](https://nips.cc/)
    - [ICML](https://icml.cc/)
    - [ICLR](https://iclr.cc/)
    - [ACL](https://acl2020.org/)
    - [EMNLP](https://2020.emnlp.org/)

## To understand the papers deeply

- To understand the Math
    - Read through and take detailed notes
    - Re derive it from scratch

- To understand the code
    - run open source codes
    - Re-implement from scratch

## Failure modes to avoid

Avoid following **only broad approach** or **only depth approach**. (only breadth or only depth)
Backing up a broad approach with tiny projects **reflects a lack of in depth understanding to recruiters**.
Much worse is to have **no working knowledge about other domain** and a **thorough depth in only one**.

![Resarch Advice 2](https://github.com/soulbliss/for-hosting/blob/master/images/research-advice/2.png?raw=true "Resarch Advice 2")

A Better way is to cover the horizontal aspect by **building the foundational skills** (course work+reading group).
Depth aspect is **achieved by doing relevant projects, internships, research work**.

![Resarch Advice 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soulbliss/for-hosting/master/images/research-advice/3.png "Resarch Advice 3")

Some pointers to keep in mind.
    - Focus on being jack of all trades but master of one area.
    - Strong candidates for jobs are: T shaped individuals.
    - Recruiters are not impressed by volume.

## Long term tips:
- Steady reading, not short term bursts. ( Take leverage of compounding )
- If early in career:
    - Work on things that help learn the most
    - Do important and meaningful work

# Learning Day
[Ir](https://www.openai.com/blog/learning-day/){:target="_blank"}

One day per week in which  employees have the option to self-study technical skills that will make them better at their job but which aren’t being learned from daily work. 

We’ve found that the biggest contributions at OpenAI come from cross-functional experts, so we either need to hire them or grow them here. 

Before Learning Day, we very rarely saw people grow cross-functionally—for example, employees coming from a software background rarely picked up machine learning (something equally rare in other organizations except academia). Since Learning Day, this kind of growth has become very common.

On a typical learning day, people do things like:

Reimplement papers.

- Reading AI papers
- Reimplementing AI papers
- Going over AI tutorials
- Having your tiny side research AI projects
- Learning about fundamentals: linear algebra, statistics etc.
- Learning about ML fundamentals: information theory, Bayesian inference etc.
- Learning about engineering. Read about new programming languages, frameworks (e.g. what is Rust?)
- Learning about management: self-management, prioritization, how renowned research labs works (e.g. Manhattan project, Bell labs)
- Learning about mechanical engineering or having your mechanical engineering research project (e.g. build a linear actuator)
- Learning about any skill that will level you up in your work (in my case, it’s better writing)


# Mathematics for the adventurous self-learner

[Ir](https://www.neilwithdata.com/mathematics-self-learner){:target="_blank"}


For over six years now, I've been studying mathematics on my own in my spare time - working my way through books, exercises, and online courses. In this post I'll share what books and resources I've worked through and recommend and also tips for anyone who wants to go on a similar adventure.

Self-studying mathematics is hard - it's an emotional journey as much as an intellectual one and it's the kind of journey I imagine many people start but then drop off after a few months. So I also share (at the end) the practices and mindset that have for me allowed this hobby to continue through the inevitable ups and downs of life (raising two young boys, working at a startup, and moving states!)

## How it all began for me

I used to love mathematics. Though I ended up getting an engineering degree and my career is in software development, I had initially wanted to study maths at university. But the reality is, that's a very tough road to take in life - the academic world is, generally speaking, a quite tortuous path with low pay, long hours, and rife with burnout. So I took the more pragmatic path and as the years went by never really found the time to reconnect with math. That was until about six years ago when I came across Robert Ghrist's online course [Calculus: Single Variable](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKc2XOQp0dMwj9zAXD5LlWpriIXIrGaNb) (at the time I took it, it was just a Coursera course but now it's freely available on YouTube). Roughly 12 weeks and many filled notebooks later, I had reignited my interest in math and felt energized and excited.

Robert, if you read this: thanks for being such an inspiring teacher.

## Why learn mathematics?

Growing up I always loved puzzles and problem solving. I would spend hours working my way through puzzle books, solving riddles, and generally latching on to anything that gives you that little dopamine hit.

If you're similar, mathematics might just be for you. Mathematics is hard. Seriously hard. And then suddenly, what was hard is easy, trivial, and you continue your ascent on to the next hard problem. It deeply rewards patience, persistence, and creativity and is a highly engaging activity - it's just you quietly working away, breaking down seemingly impossible problems and making them possible. I can't say enough how deeply satisfying and personally enriching it is to make the impossible, possible through your own hard work and ingenuity.

One thing many people don't know as well is that the mathematics you learn at most high schools is actually quite different from what you're exposed to at the university level. The focus turns from being about rote computation to logic, deduction, and reasoning. A great quote I read once is that for most of us, when we learn mathematics at school, we learn how to play a couple of notes on a piano. But at university, we learn how to write and play music.

## Picking the right books and courses for self-learning

As a self-learner, it's critical to pick books with exercises and solutions. At some point later on you can swap to books without exercises and/or solutions, but in the beginning you need that feedback to be able to learn from your mistakes and move forward when you're stuck.

The books you pick as a self-learner are also sometimes different from what you would work use if you were engaged in full-time study at a university. Personally, I lean more towards books with better exposition, motivation, and examples. In a university setting, lecturers can provide that exposition and complement missing parts of books they assign for courses, but when you're on your own those missing bits can be critical to understanding.

I recommend avoiding the Kindle copies of most books and always opting for print. Very few math books have converted to digital formats well and so typically contain many formatting and display errors. Incidentally, this is often the main source for bad reviews of some excellent books on Amazon.

I'd be remiss as well if I didn't mention the publisher Dover. Dover is a well known publisher in the math community, often publishing older books at fantastically low prices. Some of the Dover books are absolutely brilliant classics - I own many and have made sure to make note of them in my recommendations below. If you don't have a big budget for learning, go for the Dover books first.

In several places I also recommend courses from MIT OpenCourseware. These courses are completely free and often have full recorded video lectures, exam papers with solutions, etc. If you like learning by video instruction and find at various points that you're getting a bit lost in a book, try looking up an appropriate course on MIT OpenCourseware and seeing if that helps get you unstuck.

Pretty much all my books I recommend below focus on undergraduate level math, with an emphasis on pure vs applied. That's just because that's the level that I'm at and also the kind of maths I like the most!

And also, just a final note that the order of books I recommend below is not exactly the order I worked through them - rather, it's the order I think they should be worked through. Sometimes I picked up a book that was too hard and had to double back and wait until I was ready. And some books have only just come out recently as well (eg. Ivan Savov's "No BS" books) so weren't available to me when I was at that stage of learning. In short, you get to benefit from my hindsight and missteps along the way.

## Foundations

I'm going to assume a high-school level of maths is where you last left-off and that it's been some time since then that you've last done any maths. To get going, there's a couple of books I recommend:

- [The Art of Problem Solving, Vol 1 & 2 (with solutions manuals)](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Problem-Solving-Vol-Basics/dp/0977304566/)
- [No bullshit guide to math and physics](https://www.amazon.com/No-bullshit-guide-math-physics/dp/0992001005)

## A historical (and motivated) perspective

- Mathematics for the Nonmathematician (Dover) 
- Concepts of Modern Mathematics (Dover) 
- Mathematics and Its History
- [BBC's A Brief History of Mathematics (Podcast)](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00srz5b/episodes/downloads){:target="blank"}

## Proofs and mathematical logic

- An Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning - Eccles
- Book of Proof - Hammack

## Calculus/Real Analysis

- Calculus - Spivak
- Calculus - Apostol
- Introduction to Analysis - Mattuck

## Linear Algebra

- No bullshit guide to linear algebra - Savov
- Linear Algebra Done Right - Axler
- Introduction to Linear Algebra and MIT OCW Linear Algebra - Strang
- Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Applications to Computer Science - Klein

## A brief interlude to talk about study, exercises, and taming the completionist inside you

Ok, let me take a moment to share some hard-won advice. When it comes to solving exercises as you work through these books, the completionist mindset will destroy you. When I first set out on my adventure, I would refuse to move forward in a book until I had solved every problem. This worked up to a point...and that point was when I met Spivak and had to finally concede defeat.

It's hard to put a formal rule on how long you should spend on any given exercise before "giving up" and looking at the solution. I would say a lower bound should be maybe 20 minutes or so. But the upper bound? I don't know. For some problems, it can be fruitful and productive to spend days (weeks even?) thinking about them provided you're making some kind of incremental progress or still have tricks in your bag you want to apply.

For me personally, I spend around 10 hours most weeks doing math and I've had brief bursts where I've done as much as 30hrs/week when I'm between contracts, etc. What that does mean though is that one hard exercise can completely block your progress for weeks if you let it, and I'll say right now, when that does happen, it can be quite demoralizing.

Ultimately, my advice is to let your intuition and energy levels guide you - do you have the energy to chase this really hard problem down or are you in the mood for just learning the answer now? If you just want the answer now so you can move forward, look it up! There's no penalties here. You didn't lose.

I know it feels unnatural to not set hard rules around how long you should spend on a given problem, but remember that ultimately you're optimizing for your enjoyment (that's why you're doing this, right?) and long term consistency.

You will do yourself a disservice (in maths, and in life) if you burn out hot and fast.

## Some parting advice

I'm currently 35 years old, and while studying mathematics have had two wonderful kids and co-founded a startup (and I've also just started a new small business building Slack and Microsoft Teams apps and integrations). Suffice to say, life has been busy. So I wanted to offer some more general advice for anyone who also wants to study math while also staying sane. Here is what has helped me:

- Exercise. It turns out that you're not just a brain in a tank and the mind-body connection has an immense impact on your daily happiness and well-being. Exercise every day.

 - Take regular breaks and go for walks. Seemingly intractable problems have a surprising way becoming tractable after a long walk. Sunshine also has a wonderful effect on improving your overall mood and helping you sleep better.

- Alternate between easier and harder content. One way you're sure to burn out is if you are always pushing, without periods of rest. Make sure you follow up hard books with easier, almost routine, books. Sometimes it can even be beneficial to work on two books at once - one easy, one hard. Make sure to pepper in little easy wins everywhere in between the big meaty hard problems. Always follow up "failure" (ie. this problem is too hard, I give up) with "success".

- Spend time with friends and family. Self-studying maths can be a bit isolating, but ultimately we're wired to be social creatures. Don't neglect your friends and family. Invest in good relationships with people you love to be around.

# Bjork s’ Seven Study Techniques

[Ir](http://www.cwsei.ubc.ca/Files/Bjork_Seven_Study_Techniques.pdf){:target="_blank"}

- One area of research in the field of Cognitive Psycology is human learning and memory. The following information comes from decades of research by Cognitive Psychologists on how to best acquire new information.

## Allocating Attention

- Pay Attention!
- So you might be thinking, ok I'M going to stop now if all she is going to tell me is to pay attention!! Who doesn't know that, right!
- Yeah right, but I bet there's not one of you(me too) who hasn't had the experience of "reading" several pages of text only to discover that is this case reading meant running your eyes over the words without any comprehension of the meaning of those words.
- And, perhaps you've had the experience of sitting in a lecture only to discover that the professor is on a completely different topic from the one that she or he was on when you "tuned-out".
- Or have your ever practiced some skill while being completely on "auto-pilot" allowing your mind to wander?
- I know you have, we all have! Yet we continue to study, teach, try to learn, practice, and so on long, after we've caucht oureslves (or in the case of teaching, caught our students) slipping into semiconsciousness.
- If you feel yourself slipping right now. Stop! Standup, stretch, move your head from side to side.
- Well it's not that simple, but I got a kick out of imagining you doing all those things, so read on.
- The decades of attention research have told us at least two things.
    - When you try to divide your attention between two tasks, one or both tasks WILL suffer.
    - There is a limit to the amount of time that oen can sustain attention (concentrate)
- So, let's take each one in turn to see how we can be more effective.
    - First Point
        - Dive atttention is costly! Don't try to study _____(you fill in the blanck). You really must stady focused on the primary task of learning, practicing, studying. If you find yourself being distracted, remove yourself from the distracting situation. Turn off the stereo, leave the coffee shop, tell yourself that if you study/practice for 20 min then you'll spend 5 minutes thinking about those distracting thoughts.
        - For lectures, give yourself a pep talk beforehand. Even the most boring lecture will end eventually. You  must try to stay focused on what is being said. When you find yourself beginning to lose attention, refocus. Try to think of a question to ask the instructor.
        - If you're teaching, you MUST first get your student's attention. Try to think of an interesting question to ask your students. Insert an active learning demostration into your lecture. Tell a joke, an anecdote, or give a relevant real-world example.
    -  Second Point
        - A person can concentrate for a limited amount of time.
        - The amount of time a person can sustain attention differs from person to person and from task to task.
        - The amount of time a person can sustain attention differs from person to person and from task to task.
        - You will know when you've reached your limit because you will start to violate point 1, that is, your mind will start to wander.
        - I'll work through an example but of course you may need to vary the specifics depending on your own abilities and the type of task to which your are attending. 
        - Example. Let's say you have 50 minutes to study, practice, or to lecture.
        - You will actually learn more, acquire more, or teach more by studying, practicing or teach for 45 of those 50 minutes and taking a short break fro 5 min.
        - OK! I Know. You DON'T have time for a break.
        - But, if YOU don't take a break, your brain will go on one without you anyway. And your brain might decide to go on a break just when you're trying to learn/teach the most important part of the lesson.
        - So for every 50 minutes, study, practice, or teach for 25, take a break for , and then start again fro 20.
        - DON'T FORGET TO START AGAIN!
        - For the next 50 min. time period, you will probably begin to notice diminishing returns from that 5 min. break. You might find that you need a 10 min. break.
        - At the point when your breaks begin to be longer than your study sessions, take a siesta, hiatus, run around the block, swim trip to the laundry, ...., get the idea?
        - So my 5 year old is running around trying to see if he can get the dog to bite him, by 10 year old is watching Rocko's Modern Life at an ear piercing volume, and I've been at this now for over an hour. I guess that I've missed out on both points one and two. Time for a bread, that's break. You take on too, ok.

## Interpret and elaborate on what you are trying to learn

- Read the following:
    - The exposure was insufficient because of the weather conditions.
    - The crash was due to the keys sticking.
    - The numbers slid down because of the crisis abroad.
- Interpretation can be thought of deep processing, whereas elaboration can be thought of as broad processing.
- What do i mean by this? I'll tell you later, but now try to recall the threee sentences that you just read on the previous slide. DON'T GO BACK TO PEAK. Can you do it?
- Remembering the sentences was most likely difficult for you.
- The sentences didn't make any sence.
- Because the sentences din't make sense, you were unlikey to have been able to interpret them.
- Read the sentences again:
    - The exposure was insufficient because of the weather conditions. (Taking a picture)
    - The crash was due to the keys sticking. (Computer break-down)
    - The numbers slid down because of the crisis abroad. (Stock-market)
- Again, interpretation can e though of as deep processing, whereas elaboration can be thought of as broad processing.
- What do I mean by this? I'll tell you later, REALLY, but now try to recall the three sentence again. It's easier this time. right?
- Ok, so you’re thinking well of course it’s easier I saw them befause(repetition)
- Also, I tried to recall them once already(retrieval practice)
- Yes, that’s true, repetition and retrieval practice are both important for learning, memory, and skill acquisition, but we'll get to that later, too.
- Research has shown that the sentences with the "clues" would have been easier to remember than the sentences without the "clues" even after having seen them only once, because you we able to **interpreter** the sentences with the "clues".
- Interpretation means really understanding what you're trying to learn, thinking deeply about the process that you're practicing, throughly comprehending the information being presented, and if you're teaching, using examples that make sense to your students.
- If you don't undertand, you won't learn, remember, or improve your performace.
- And, if you  only kinda understand, you'll only kinda learn, remember, or improve.
- So how do you know if you thoroughly understand, or you only kinda understand?
- When you thoroughly understand you should be able to (part 2) elaborate.
- Elaboration provides breadth of processing.
- You shoud be able to come up with how the book information is related to what you learned in lecture (same as **and** different from), or how what you learned in lecture relates to something that you have observed directly.
- Perhaps the content from two different courses can be compared or contrasted.
- When you practice, you should be able to to relate parts of the movements or musical piece to one another.
- When you teach, you should use several examples. You should illustrate how the  current lecture material fits with the previous lectures and with the information that will be coming in future lectures.
- And the great thing about **elaboration** is that it provides **variability**



## Make your studying variable (e.g., location, interpretations, examples)

- I just illustrated how elaboration relates to the next study technique: variability. Also, taking a study break provides variabilty. Thus I'm trying to illustrate how what came before relates to the current point. Can you find any other study techniques incorporated in this presentation? Now I'm asking you to generate (the 7th technique). See, I practice what I preach!
- Have you ever been told to pick a single quiet place and then to always study in that same place?? That way you will become "accustomed" to studying there and will be more effective, right?
- **WRONG!!!**
- Actualy, the opposite is true. You're better off studying in many different locations.
- I bet I got your attention with that one.
-  Are you thinking, all right! She’s finally teling me something that I can use. No problem, I'll be happy to study all over campus, I'll practice everywhere, I'll teach my class outside occasionally.
- The rest of the stuff she's been talking about sounded like it would take forever!
- I'll just study in different locations.
- Oh, I forgot to mention, the size of the increase in performace that you will see as a result of changing your study locations (without any other changes in your study behavior)  in MINUSCULE!
- A much better  way to increase your performace is to incorporate variation in the way that you think about the material.
- Play the musical piece at a number of different tempos.
- Make the shout from several different locations on the court.
- Present th emost cirical information across several different lectures.
- Think about the material in a number of different ways.
- Doesn't this sound like elaboration?
- I told you that **elaboration** produces **variation**. Guess what! **variation** produces **elaboration**.
- One way to increase variation in the way that you think about the information, is to space your study.
- Which brings us to the 4th study technique.

## Space your studying of a topic or area and repeat your study several times

- You have 4 hours to study for two tests, one in Class A the other in Class B. What you have do?
- Do you spend two hours on Course A and then two hours on Course B?
- I don't think so, or this study point would be called massing.
- You're much better off studying Course A for on hour, then Course B for  an hour, then Course A for an hour, then Course B.
- Spacing your study in this away is an easy way to increase variability (again, increasing elaboration)
- The changes of you continuing to think about a topic only in one way decreases when you space your study.
- Spacing your study in this way is an easy way to increase variability(again, increasing elaboration).
- Oh no! She’s losing it. Now she’s starting to repeat herself (nto to mention writing in the third  person). She needs an attention break.
- Well yea, but also I'm trying to illustrate the point that each time you study something, you will encode the information somewhat sifferently.
- Especially when time intervenes between the two study sessions.
- Also, you need to study the same information more than once, hence the repetition.
- Spacing your study is an easy way to increase variability (again, increasing elaboration)
- Just a bit more of practicing what I preach.

## Organize and structure the information that you are during a test

- List the months of the year.
- How long id that take you?
- Did you get them all?
- Pretty trivial, huh?
- Now list the months of the year alphabetically?
- How long did tha take?
- Are you sure that you got the all?
- Are you sure that you got them all?
- So with that little demo under your belt, can you think what I'm going to tell you about the importance of organization and structure?
- If you spend something trying to figure out what I'm about to say, you'll learn them better that way. It's called generation. I know I said that before (that's called repetition). It's been a while though, that's called spacing and we all know: Spacing your study is an easy way to increase variability (again, increasing elaboration)
- When I was an undergrad I really could have used the following advice myself.
- Whenever I sat down to read a chapter from my textbook I'd just sit down and start reading. I never previewed the chapters by looking over the section headings to see what the author's organization of the chapter was.
- How many of you read the chapter summaries at the beginning of the chapters before you beging reading?
- Do you put outlines up on a view graph before you begin lecturing so that your students will know the organization of your lectures?
- I know, who has that kind of time? Best just to begin.
- But remember the experience of trying to reall the months of the year in alphabetical order? Without the months of the year in alphabetical order? Without the months being organized that way in your memory, it was very difficult.
- So give yourself a break. Notice the organization provided to you by author, lecturer, coach, etc.
- If you are the author, lecturer, coach give your students a break and provide them with an outline.
- Before you begin reading the chapter, flip through the chapter noticing the paragraphs headings and sub-headings as well as the words in bold. Look at the graphs and pictures.
- After reading the chapter, hearing the lecture, practicing the task take time to structure the information in a way that is most meaningful to you. Did you find that the author's organization worked best? Is so, why did it work for you? If not, how could you organized the information better?
- After your lecture, recap/review the main points paying particular attention to emphasizing how the points fit together.
- Of all study techniques, this one  is probably the most familiar. I'm sure that many of you have learned one or two mnemonic techniques already.
- Most mnemonic techniques take advantage of the power of visualition.
- For those of you who haven't mastered a technique, I'll teach you one now.
- You'll need three sheets of paper and a pen or pencil. I'll wait while you get them.
- On the next slide is a list of words. Try to learn them. Spend about 3 seconds per word.
- Don't write the words down. You'll get to use the pen and paper in a bit.

- |oil       |  footbal|
baseball  | gas
ruler | snow
coat  | coal
chisel| screwdriver
rock  | hat
hail  | sleet
plain | river
plain | baketball

- Ok now write down all the words that you can remember.
- When you think that you can't get anymore, you may turn back to the previous page to check your recall.
- How many did you get?
- Now I'm going to teach you mnemonic technique know as the Method of Loci.
- Think of any well know route that you take regulary. For example, start in your room then leave your house/dorm go to Tappan squared, think of stops along the way.
- On the route, take note of 18 distinct stopping places.
- On a new sheet of paper, write down the 18 stopping places along the route (if you use this technique often you will soon be able to use it without the written cues).
- For the next list of items that I'm going to give you, visualize the item/concept in each of the 18 locations. You may look at the location list, but DON'T write down the words to be learned.
- For example, let's say that I was trying to remember a shopping list and I needed to buy salt, bread, and tomatoes. If the first stop on my lkist was my bedrrom then i'd image two giant salt shakers for pillows in my bed. If the next stop was my driveway, then I'd imagine not being able to get the car our of the drive because it was made of soft bread.
- I’m sure you have the idea by now. The more outrageous, weird, or funny the image, the better.
- So if you've written you location list, forward to the next  slide and try to learn the list.
-|wood|tennis|
gasoline|swimmig
paper|soccer
hammer|hurricane
saw|tornado
nails|rain
mountain|shirt
hill|dress
valley|hat

- Now try to recall the second set of 18 words. You may do the recall on the set sheet of paper with the 18 locations listed.
- Check back.
- How many did you get this time?
- Most people recall all 18 items when using the mnemonic technique
- Visualization is a very powerful study technique, which is limited only by the creativity of the learner
- Disgressing for a moment, you may have noticed, also, the organization of the second list. Even if you didn't use the mnmoniv, the second list would have been easier to learn becuase it was organized by category (just a bit of spacing and  repetition).
- Visualization can also be used as an effective practice technique.
- You can visualize yourself playing the musical piece that you’re about to perform, or hitting the ball, or making  a shot.
- You can visualize yourself in the location that you will take the test while you're studying the night before.
- During the test, you can mentally reinstate the contex you were in while you studied for the exam. If you can’t remember a word or concept while taking the exam, don’t panic Think back to the context in which you were studying What other 
things were happening at the time? What other things were you learning?
- You can mentally reinstate both the physical and mental contexts that you were in while studying.
- If you are a coach or teacher, provide opportunities for your students to visualize the skill or material that you are trying to teach.
- During  lectures, provide tools that help students to visualize the concepts being presented. Graphs, props, and demonstrations can all provide opportunities to visualize the material.

## GENEREATE, GENEREATE, GENEREATE, GENEREATE, RETRIEVE, RETRsIEVE, RETRIEVE!

- It’s well known that people will tend to remember the first thing that they learn and the last thing that they learn (these effects) are known as primacy and recency). That's why I presented the two most important points first (attention) and last (generation and retrieval practice) in the presentation.
- If i had to pick one point that I think is the most important to use and master it would be this one: Generation and retrieval practice.
- Ok for those of you who know me really well, stop laughing! I didn’t pick this point as the most important simply because it’s been my research are  now for more years than I care to admit. It really is the most important, really!
- By generating (or producing the information) before the textbook instructor or coach can tell you that same information, the better able you'll be to gauge how much you already know  or don't know.
- Guess what, even if you generate the wrong answers, you'll remember the right ones better after correcting yourself than if you never attemped to generate the information before.
- So when you flip through you textbook taking note of the organization before you begin to read the chapter, try to generate the details of each of the chapter subheadings. For example...
- Let s ’ say you are preparing to read the second chapter of a cognitive textbook. The chapter is entitled "Perceptual Processes". The first subheading is entitled "The Sensory Register". Try coming up with what you think  the sensory register is all about. Generate the meaning of the concept.
- Sensory: must to something about the senses.
- Register: must be something about keeping a record (of the senses!)
- If you could do that before you even studied the chapter, you could certaintly do it on the test!
- The next subheading is entitled “The Function of the Sensor Function of the Sensoryg y Re ister”. Tr ister”. Try to generate what you think the function of  a sensory gy y storage system ma stem may be.
- Even if you were to generate the wrong function, once you correct yourself as you read  through the chapter, you’ll remember the correct function better than if you simply read about the function.
- Now that you’re done previewing the chapter, how you apply generation during the reading of the chapter.
- Step number one: Take out your highlighting pen.
- Step number two: Make sure your highlighter has plenty of ink.
- Step number three : Throw away your row away your highlighter!!!
- I recently looked back to some of my textbooks from college. My first year textbooks were covered with highlighting ink. Just about every word in every chapter was highlighted! Why bother? Now if you re ’ saying to yourself I've always used a highlighter and I’ve always done really well on test, good for you! But why are you wasting your time on this study techniques presentation if you're already doing really well? For those of you who aren't, throwh it way NOW.
- You are much much much better off reading a paragraph or two at a time (more once you’ve practiced this skill and are
good at it), then putting the textbook aside and generating a summary of the information tha you've just read in your own words.
- Then, check the textbook to make sure that you have correctly summarized the information makin gany error corrections as needed and incorporating any information that you have left out.
- All the time, trying to make sense out of what you are learning (interpretation) and interconnecting what you are learning with other information (elaboration).
- You may be thinking  STOP RIGHT THERE!!! You're talking about taking hours to read what would normally take me only about 30 minutes to run my eyes across.
- Yes, sadly it is true. Using this very powerful technique will doble if not triple your reading time.
- But, when you sit down to studyng for the test, you'll discover that you already know most of the information. Also, when your grades start to improve, you'll be glad that you spent the extra time studying effectevely (time spent studying only count if it's spent studying well!!!)
- Instructors can give their students opportunities to generate answers during lecture by asking questions and giving students TIME to answer the questions.
- If, the instructor asks a question, come up with an answer (even if it's wrong) You are much better off trying to answer the question yourself (generating) than taking  amental break while other students think up the answer.
- By the way if you hope to have any chance of filling in gaps (generating) in your lecture notes, it’s very important that soon after lecture you review your notes. You might remember something that the instructor said that you failed to include in your notes.
- Now the second part of this most important point:  retrieval practice.
- How will you know that you’re ready to  take the test that all of your study  efforts have been effective, and that you will do well on the exam?  PRACTICE RETRIEVING THE INFORMATION BEFORE THE TEST!!!
- Retrieval practice provides very effective feedback. You will know immediately if you know the information or if you need to study it some more.
- Even better, retrieval practice makes the information more likely to be remembered the next time you try to retrieve it!
- So, how do you do retrieval practice?
- Remember those notes you made while you read the textbook, and those wonderfully complete lecture notes? You can now use your notes to practice retrieving the information on the notes. ALL OF IT! Unless of course you’re psychic and know what the instructor planning for the test.
- You practice retrieving the information by You practice retrieving the information by looking at keywords in the notes and then generation all of the information relating to those key words.
- Some people prefer to do this with 3*5 cards  and call them flashcards.
- It doesn't matter if you use flashcards or review your notes what matter is that you don't simply read over your notes!!!
- You must generate, You must generate, produce from memory, all of the information that is contained within you notes.
- You won’t have the notes during the test, so reading over them and saying yup i know that won't do any good.
- Look at a keywoard, e.g., Sensory Register, put away the notes and then practice retrieving everything in your notes about the sensory register.
- You might discover that you know the definition of the sensory register, and it’s functions, but you could only recall three of its five characteristics. Next time through your notes you ll ’ be much more likely to remember all five of the characteristics.
- You continue going through your notes or continue going through your notes or flashcards until you can correctly retrieve everything!!
- So, you’ve been attending every time you’ve worked on the course. You’ve checked back with the textbook during
 your effective reading and you're  sure that everything from the textbook is in your our notes. You’ve reviewed your lecture notes filling in any gaps (getting help from the instructor if needed).
 - You’ve interpreted (made sure that you understood the concepts) and elaborated everything in your notes.  You’ve thought about each concept in several different ways. You've used visual imagary ways. You've used  visual imagary when appropiate. You’ve noted the organization and structure of all chapters and lectures.
 - You’ve spaced your studying and retrieval practice allowing more and more space (time)  between each study repetition. And the last several times tha you went through your notes/flashcards, you were able to retrieve everything in those notes. 
 - YOU ARE NOW READY TO TAKE THE TEST. Relax!
