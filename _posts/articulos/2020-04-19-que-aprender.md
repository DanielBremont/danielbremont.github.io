# How do you decide what to learn next?

I am doing a series called 52-technologies-in-2016 [https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016) where in I learn a new technology, build a small app, and blog about it every week. 

I maintain an Evernote where I write down all the interesting topics or projects I find. I go through the list and randomly pick any topic that excites me that day and then work over the weekend to publish something. This helps me keep in continuous learning loop.

**Sounds cool, how much time do you spend every week?**

It depends from 5 hours to 15 hours depending on the topic. On Saturday I learn a topic by reading documentation or watching videos tutorials by their creators(if I can find) or if I have a book then I read first few chapters. Sunday, I start with building something and then documenting the process in the blog by end of Sunday.

Don't underestimate "this is interesting". Couple it with a goal (like building a personal site, doing some home automation, building a NAS) and make sure you take notes (if not a blog). You'll learn heaps in no time.

I pick a project I want to complete or a cause I want to contribute to. Then I look at the smallest step I can take to work toward that (learn the basis of a new language, protocol). Then I iterate (learn a framework, tool). Then I try to close a bug or release the project to the wild. This usually leads to comments on a PR or someone opening bugs with the project, and then I have to learn something new to fix it.
I think it's much easier to learn things when you have a goal because you have to learn tiny nuggets of knowledge that are useful. I find learning something without the context of how to apply it to the real world is very difficult, so I generally don't just go out and learn things (tech-wise) without a legitimate usage in mind.

I've recently started this method:
- create a list of all the tools/products/whatever you use at work
- rate them from 1 to 5 (5 you are an expert on this topic)
- then pick the most important one for your job and try to increase your grade

The grade is totally subjective, but still it helps.

For the "next big thing" I take a look regularly to the thoughtworks radar [1]. That's a nice overview.

I've got a TODO list of things I want to learn that's populated enough to keep me busy for years to come. I just wish I had more time to act on it.
The items on my list are half concrete tasks and half topics to learn. The subjects are very diverse, I have a broad range of interests.

Here's a few from the top:

    1. Learn enough classical mechanics to do a stable n body simulation
    2. Build a piece of furniture with mortise and tenon joinery
    3. Implement a prototype compiler for that GPGPU/shader programming language I've been dreaming about for years
    4. Get an Indian fighter kite and learn to fly it
    5. Implement a multiple revolution Lambert problem solver to plan the badassest Kerbal Space Program mission ever
    6. Write a simulator for gyroscopic motion and compare the results with my toy gyroscopes.
That's enough to occupy my Saturdays for the next five years. Both, the sunny and the rainy ones.

Mostly what I anticipate I will need for the job. For my own pleasure I choose tools whose proponents talk with a reasonable voice. I dismiss any technonology when I see people that:

- Says that the rest of the world is doing it wrong and they will fix the situation with this "change of paradigm".
- Presents their products as a "social movement" that's "challenging the industry as we know it".
- Promises 10x productivity.
- In general, bases their success on attacking others. Specially if they say things like "everybody knows exceptions are like cancer".
- Uses grandilocuent names to call a two thousand lines library.
- The resulting code looks like gibberish. The most likely a child can understand it, the better. It it's directed at the elite programmers, bad.
- Doesn't put enough care on tooling.

Edit: OK, it's a very negative answer, but it's effective. It quickly discards 99% of shiny new things.

When in doubt, learn more math and cs.
