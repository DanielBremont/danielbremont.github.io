- **Simplicity :** By simplicity, Hoare means a small range of instructions with uniform format, each having a simple effect that can be described and understoos independently of other instructions. Terensess or simplicity of syntax is a common goal, one supported by studies of notations and reflected to some extent in recent designs.

- **Orthogonality :** Related to simplicity is orthogonality: th enotion that there should not be more than one way expressing any action in the language, and that all language components are mutually independent. In a truly orthogonal language, a small set of basic facilities may be combined without arbitrary restrictions according to systematic rules. Orghogonality may result in arbitrary complexity via this unrestricted combination. Is is endorsed in the literature in a limited role: as a principle for eliminating redundant expressions and hence for contribuating to overall simplicity. This limited orthogonality is implied above in Hoare´s meaning of simplicity.

- **Abstraction :** The motivation behind many language design decisions is to spare the programmer the 'messy' bits, the low-level, machine-oriented details of programming. The emphasis is on high-level operation, with the idea that high-level expression matches more closely the problem domain. As will discussed later, this is a restrictive interpretation of abstraction.


- 256 - This is 2 to the 8th power. It is the number of different numbers that you can store in a byte (8 bits , usually ranging from 0 to 255. An 8 bit number can be represented by two hexadecimal digits or three octal digits.

- AI - Artificial Intelligence.

- ASCII - Pronounced ass-key. Stands for the American Standard Code for Information Interchange. It is a 7bit code for characters. For example: the letter ’x’ is represented as 1111000. Because it is only 7 bits long, an ASCII character can be stored in a byte.

- Abstraction - Removing detail of something to focus on a subset of the features without confusing details.

- Address - a) A location in memory or identifying a particular piece of memory. b) An identification that allows
access to something such as an internet address which allows one to access a device on the internet.

Binary is a place-value system in which each bit position denotes a power of 2 (unlike decimal which uses 10 symbols and powers of 10). k bits of information can represent 2k different numbers. For example counting in 3 bits of binary you can count from 0 to 7: 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111.

Bit - A binary digit. The smallest unit of information represented by one of two states (usually 0 or 1). It is often denoted by a lower case ’b’ as in Mbs (mega-bits per second). Or the amount of information gained when answering a yes or no question.

For instance in C and Processing statements inside parentheses are treated as one statement that is either executed together or not. Generally the only “entry” into a block of code is at the top of the code.

The language of mathematics is distinct from natural languages in that it aims to communicate abstract, logical ideas with precision and unambiguity. As a result, it is equipped with a system of specialized symbols and vocabularies — each with its own level of generality and formality.

Among these, there’s a particular subset of terms that is uniquely foundational and appropriate to our pursuit: the higher mathematical jargon. Loosely speaking, these are a set of specialized terms that fall into most — if not all — of the following categories:

- Specific to **higher mathematics**
- **English-looking** (with a near-technical meaning)
- **Frequently-occurring**
- **Cross-disciplinary** (i.e., not field-specific)

In brief, these are terms that are generally accessible to most, yet still provide us with a glimpse of the world of non-miniaturized mathematics — and the way their practitioners act and think. In fact, in what follows, we’ve compiled a list of 106 such terms — along with some in-depth exploration of their **definitions**, **examples**, **relevance** and **implications**.

So if you’re ready to dive into this fascinating world that is known as mathematics, then let’s get started!

(and if you’re looking for a concise rendition of all the 106 terms featured in this glossary, then you might find the following **higher math jargon mindmap** both interesting and useful.)

## Abstraction

The process of extracting the underlying structures, patterns, or properties of some mathematical objects, with the intention of generalizing these findings to a broader class of objects. These include, for example:

- Finding the shared properties of similar polynomials
- Formalizing the general pattern of a sequence
- Establishing a one-to-one correspondence between two sets
- Constructing an alternate axiomatic system for Euclidean geometry

At first, abstraction can seem a bit unappealing due to its higher cognitive demand and lack of connection to real-world phenomena. However, it can often turn out to be an integral force in bringing about a broaden applicability to a field — along with some unification in between the fields.

## Abstract Nonsense

A colloquial term for category theory (a mathematical subject dedicated to the notion of category and the formalization of mathematical structures), or the methods and arguments that are related to it.

Since different branches of mathematics deal with different mathematical structures satisfying the definition of a [category, category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory) theory can be regarded as a **unifying theory of mathematics** — whose results are applicable to a wide range of disciplines.

In particular, if a proposition follows from abstract nonsense, then it means that its argument has more to do with the underlying categorical structure of its objects — rather than the field where it’s found. And since such arguments are often highly abstract and long-winded by nature, they are also alternatively referred to as “**general abstract nonsense**” or “**generalized abstract nonsense**“.

![Abstract Nonsence](https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Category-Theory-Diagram-400x400.png.webp "Abstract Nonsence")


## Abuse of notation

The act of inadvertently or deliberately using notations in a way that’s not entirely syntactically correct — but which simplifies the exposition and makes the passage easier to understand. For example, one might say that:

- “R is distributive” — rather than “$$(\mathbb{R},+,×)$$ is distributive.”
- “3 is differentiable” — rather than “the function defined by the rule $$x\mapsto 3$$ for all real x, is differentiable.”
- “$$a+b+c=c+b+a$$” — rather than “$$(a+b)+c=(c+b)+a$$”.

In the cases where the context and the assumptions are made clear and well understood, abuses of notation are usually harmless (if not actually desirable). In other cases, however, the same might not be true, and can amount to a misuse of notation — which is a faux-pas in mathematics (such as the case of $$\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}=\frac{y}{x}$$).

## Algorithm

A finite series of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions to solve a specific set of computable problems. It takes a finite amount of initial input(s), processes them unambiguously at each operation, before returning its outputs within a finite amount of time. Some examples of algorithm in mathematics include:

- The **Euclidean algorithm** (for finding the greatest common factor of two natural numbers)
- The **long division algorithm** (and its variants)
- The **simplex algorithm** (for finding the optimal solution under a set of linear constraints)

In essence, algorithms are created to streamline the solution-finding process for a specific set of problems, though it can also remove the necessity of thinking and understanding in the process. For a a series of instructions that are quasi-algorithmic and broader in nature, the term “**general procedure**” is sometimes used (which, like an algorithm, could also involve some element of [heuristics](#Heuristics) or [recursion](#Recursion)).

## Almost

A handy adverb similar to its usage in English, but can take on specific meanings depending on the context. For example:

- “Almost all elements in a set” usually means “all but a finite/countable amount of negligible elements in the set.”
- “Almost no integer” usually means “only a finite subset of integers.”
- “A property holds almost everywhere (in a measure space)” usually means “everywhere in a set except a subset of measure zero.”
- “An event occurs almost surely” usually means that “the event has a probability of 1, even though it does not include all of the possible outcomes.”
- “An event occurs almost never” usually means that “the event has a probability of 0, even though it does contain some of the possible outcomes.”

Here, notice that “almost” doesn’t necessarily mean that the exceptional cases are “small”, and hence one is perfectly well-justified in making claims such as “almost all real numbers are transcendental” — or that “the dart almost never lands on the circumference of the board.”

## Ansatz

A term of German origin meaning “initial placement of a tool at a work piece” (Wikipedia), and is used in mathematics to refer to the initial, additional mathematical assumptions made to kick start the problem solving process — but which are later confirmed to be parts of the actual solution as well. Some examples of ansatz in mathematics include:

- The adoption of linear regression model to fit the data points (i.e., linear ansatz)
- The assumption that the solutions to a differential/recurrent equation take an exponential form (exponential ansatz)
- The assumption that the solution to a system of linear equations is expressible in terms of a particular vector (ansatz of particular solution).

Metaphorically speaking, the use of ansatz can be liken to drawing a picture by first establishing a framework, in that if it succeeds, then the framework can be reused as an ansatz later on, but if it doesn’t, then it’s usually discarded and marked as an instance of failure.

## Arbitrarily

An adverb attached to a mathematical adjective X to make clear that something is “**X with little limitation or restraint.**” For example:

- An **arbitrarily large** function is a function capable of assuming values larger than any fixed choice of real number — regardless of the size of the latter.

- An **arbitrarily small** positive sequence is a sequence capable of assuming values smaller than any fixed choice of positive real number — regardless of the “tininess” of the latter.

- An **arbitrarily long** progression is a progression whose number of members can be made to exceed than any choice of natural number regardless the size of the latter.

In general, “arbitrarily” is a foundational term in number theory and mathematical analysis, and can also occur in other topics where some form of degree and ordering are involved (e.g., polynomial ring).

## Arbitrary

An adjective used to refer to a choice made without any specific criterion or restraint (e.g., arbitrary integer, arbitrary division of a set, arbitrary permutation of a sequence). It corresponds to the term “**any**” and the universal quantifier $$\forall$$, and hints at an element of generality in the phrase where it’s found (e.g., statement $$P$$ holds for an arbitrary $$n \in \mathbb{N}$$).

## Axiom

Axioms, also known as postulates, are mathematical premises which are assumed to be true and along with definitions, form the foundation of a mathematical theory.

 general, axioms can be divided into two types: logical and non-logical. The logical axioms are the ones pertaining to the logical part of mathematics (e.g., $$[A\rightarrow (B \wedge -B)] \rightarrow -A\,$$), while the non-logical axioms are the ones pertaining to the nature of the theory itself (which might or might not be self-evident by nature).

 For example, the parallel postulate — which stands as the most well-known (non-logical) axiom among the five in Euclidean geometry — states that:

 > “If a line segment intersects two straight lines forming two interior angles on the same side that sum to less than two right angles, then the two lines, if extended indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles sum to less than two right angles.”

 And just as one can start with the axioms and work forward towards its consequences (i.e., a major component of theorisation), one can also take a body of knowledge and work backward towards its axioms (a process known as axiomatization).

In most likelihood, a body of knowledge is framed in terms of multiple axioms (i.e., an axiomatic system) — instead of a single axiom. In which case, extra care should be taken to ensure that the system is consistent (i.e., does not produce contradiction). Some famous axiomatic systems in mathematics include, among others:

- The Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms of set theory
- The Peano axioms of arithmetic
- The Kolmogorov axioms of probability

## Beauty

A highly subjective concept corresponding to the aesthetic response to the purity, abstractness, simplicity, depth, or the orderliness of mathematics. For example, one of the equations most commonly regarded as beautiful is the Euler’s identity, which states that:

- $$\displaystyle e^{i\pi}+1=0 $$

Since aesthetic perception of mathematics varies across individuals, other terms — such as “elegant“, “enlightening”,  “exhilarating” or “interesting” — have also been used. However, it has also been argued that what’s elegant or interesting is often different from what’s beautiful in mathematics, and that beauty pertains more to the **content** — rather than the presentation of  it.

## By Inspection

A fancy way of saying “**just by looking**“, or that “the result can be obtained with a minimal amount of derivations, computations or background.” For example, one might say that:

> "By inspection, the function $$f(x)=x^2+2x+1$ has a zero at $x=-1$$".

In lectures and educational texts, phrases such as “by inspection” or “it can be easily shown that” are often used as a way of simplifying the presentation of the subject matter — as well as a way of inviting others to verify their work (some of which might very well involve some tedious computations). 

## Canonical

An adjective derived from the root “canon”, which means standard convention or exemplar representative. However, when attached to a noun, it can take on a slightly different meaning. For example:

- A canonical proof is one that has been accepted as the standard, conventional proof (e.g., Euclid’s proof for the infinitude of primes).
- A canonical definition is one that is considered the most natural for adoption purposes (e.g., an even number as a number divisible by 2).
- A canonical map is one which arises naturally from the definition of objects, and which tends to be the one that’s the most structurally-preserving (i.e., the natural homomorphism from a group to its induced quotient group).
- A canonical form is one which has been regarded as the simplest representation of an object, and which allows the object to be identified in a unique way (e.g., [0] as the set of integers with remainder 0 — when divided by some natural number).

## Chaos

States of apparently-random disorders and irregularities governed by simple laws and initial conditions. Contrary to its popular usage, a chaotic behavior is deterministic and sensitive to its initial inputs — in the sense that tiny changes to the initial conditions can lead to widely diverging outcomes (e.g., butterfly effect).

More generally, the mathematical study of chaotic systems is known as the chaos theory — an interdisciplinary field which combines the theory of dynamic systems with a wide range of applications in the real world (e.g., weather forecast, road traffic, financial market, electrical circuit).

## Characterisation

A set of conditions which uniquely defines a mathematical object, in the sense that it is logically equivalent to — but distinct from — the definition of the object. In which case, the object is said to be “characterised” by those conditions. For example:

- An **equilateral** triangle is defined as a triangle with three equal sides. but it can also be characterised as a triangle formed by doubling some 30-60-90 triangle in a certain way.
- An **invertible square matrix** is defined as a square matrix with an inverse, though it can also be characterised as a matrix with a non-zero determinant.
- The **natural exponential function** is often defined as the exponential function with base e, though it can also be characterised as the function with the assignment $$\displaystyle x \mapsto \lim_{n \to \infty} \left( 1+\frac{x}{n} \right)^n$$

In general, a characterisation tends to provide additional insight into the nature of the object itself, and might even be used as an alternate definition of the object if one chooses to.

## Chasing

A term used in conjunction with other words to refer to the process of finishing a proof or solving a math problem — by **jumping** from one part to another in a logical and sequential manner. For example: 

- When one attempts to solve a geometry problem by going from one angle to another, one is said to be angle chasing. 
-* When one attempts to prove a claim involving objects with multiple indices by going from one index to another, one is said to be index chasing (or engaging in an index battle).
- When one attempts to prove a set-theoretic claim by going from a statement about elements to another, one is said to be element chasing.
- When one attempts to prove a property of some morphisms by tracing the elements in a commutative diagram, one is said to be diagram chasing.
- More generally, the term “chasing” can also be applied to other commonly-occurring objects such as equations and integrals — though such usages tend to be less common within the mathematical community.

## Compact

The quality of a set or a space to be closed and bounded (e.g., closed interval, rectangles) — or other generalizations of it (e.g., the open cover definition of compactness).

In general, compactness is a key concept in topology, analysis and algebraic geometry, as many properties in these fields are often identified to be equivalent to it — or as a result of it (e.g., Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, extreme-value theorem, Heine-Borel Theorem).

## Conjecture

A notably important mathematical statement which is suspected to be true, but whose proof or disproof is still pending (even if the supporting evidence might be overwhelming). Some of the most famous conjectures of the 21st century include:

Currently Unsolved Conjectures

- The Goldbach conjecture
- The twin prime conjecture
- The Riemann hypothesis
- Recently Solved Conjectures

The four color theorem

- Fermat’s last theorem
- The Poincaré conjecture

Historically, a conjecture can be resolved in three ways: if proved, it usually becomes a theorem. If disproved, it automatically becomes a false conjecture. In the case where the conjecture is shown to be neither provable nor refutable from the axioms (as in the case with the continuum hypothesis and the parallel postulate), one might choose to adopt it (or the negation of it) as an additional axiom to the system — and work from there.

## Constructive Proof

A proof of an existential claim (i.e., a claim of the form “there exists…”) which derives its validity by directly constructing the object being specified in the claim. This is to be contrasted from a non-constructive proof — which proves the same claim without ever constructing the said object.

For example, the statement “there is a prime number exceeding 1,000,000,000,000,000” can be proved both constructively and non-constructively — in the following ways:

- If the claim is proved by exhibiting a number that is both prime and greater than 1,000,000,000,000,000, then the proof is said to be constructive.
- If the claim is proved by demonstrating that the opposite cannot occur (e.g., proof by contradiction), then the proof is said to be non-constructive.

In general, constructive and non-constructive proofs are both valid ways of establishing an existential claim, though the latter approach could on occasion be taken as a sign of unresourcefulness, and is indeed an approach rejected by the constructivists — who choose to interpret the existential quantifier in a slightly stricter manner.

## Contrapositive
Given an implication of the form  P $$P \rightarrow Q$$, the statement $\neg Q \rightarrow \neg P$  is known as its contrapositive, and is logically equivalent to the implication itself. For example: 

- The contrapositive of if $$f(x)\ge 2$$, then $$f(x)^2\ge 4$$  is if $$f(x)^2 < 4$$, then $$f(x) < 2$$.
- The contrapositive of all composite integers are odd is all even integers are prime.

Since an implication is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, this often leads one to prove a statement by proving its contrapositive instead. In fact, this approach — also known as **proof by contraposition** — is especially useful when the truth of the contrapositive is easier to establish than that of the implication itself (such as the proof of “if n2 is odd, then n is odd”).

## Converse

Given an implication of the form $P \rightarrow Q$, the statement $Q \rightarrow P$ is known as its <strong>converse</strong>. For example:

- The converse of if $$f(x)\ge 2$$, then $$f(x)^2\ge 4 is $f(x)^2\ge 4$$, then $$f(x)\ge 2$$".
- The converse of all composite integers are odd is all odd integers are composite".

Unlike the case with contrapositive, the truth of the converse is generally independent from that of the implication itself, even though both are often considered in conjunction with each other — for the simple reason that if one were to convey sufficiency, then the other would convey necessity and vice versa.

## Corollary

A statement whose validity can be readily deduced from a previous, more notable statement, but whose importance tends to be secondary in nature. 

## Counterexample

An example which disproves a universal claim (i.e., a claim of the form “for all…”). For example, the claim $$2^{p}-1$$ is prime for all prime numbers $$p$$” is false, because when $$p=11$$, we have that: 

> $$2^p-1 = 2^{11}-1 = 2047 = 23 \times 89$$

In this case, since p=11 is also the smallest example which falsifies the claim, it is also referred to as the minimal counterexample to the claim. More generally, a disproof using minimal counterexample is preferred for its simplicity and informativeness — as it might provide one with better insight on how to modify the condition of the statement so as to rule out the exceptional cases.

## Deep Result

A deep result — or a deep theorem — is a mathematical statement whose proofs require a fundamentally new way of thinking, or a set of methods and techniques that are far beyond the concepts needed to formulate the claim. It frequently draws upon mathematical machinery that is atypical to the field, and is usually one for which no elementary proof is known. For example:

- The irrationality of π is known to be a deep result, since its proof requires a significant amount of development in real analysis, and cannot be tackled by simply appealing to the definition of π or irrationality alone.

- The fundamental theorem of algebra is often considered to be a deep result, since even if it can be proved in multiple ways, each of its proofs invariably relies on the analytic completeness of real number —  a concept which is non-algebraic by nature.

In some occasions, a deep result can also carry with it a connotation of being groundbreaking or influential. For example, Field medalist and mathematician Timothy Gowers defines a deep result as follows:

> “A result is deep if it depends on a breakthrough idea that depends on a breakthrough idea that depends on a breakthrough idea that depends on a breakthrough idea that depends on a breakthrough idea that…”

## Definition

A condition which unambiguously qualifies what a mathematical term is and what it is not, and can pertain to both a mathematical object (e.g., mesh) or its property (e.g., boundedness of a set).

Unlike the case in English, mathematical definitions must be well-defined, since they — along with axioms — form the basis of an axiomatic system, and thus can play a vital role in the process of successful theorisation as well.

## Discovery

The act of identifying a previously-unidentified mathematical pattern, or establishing the validity or the invalidity of a mathematical claim. This presupposes the existence of a mathematical reality, which is well-articulated by, say, G.H. Hardy in his A Mathematician’s Apology:

> “I believe that mathematical reality lies outside us, that our function is to discover or observe it, and that the theorems which we prove, and which we describe grandiloquently as our ‘creations’, are simply the notes of our observations.”

Under this viewpoint, mathematics can be thought of as an endeavour encompassing both discovery and creation, in that even if mathematical truths and patterns exist independent of our actions and choices, we are still free to conceptualize them using whichever concepts and statements we can come up with.


## Elementary Proof

A proof of a claim which — while not necessarily a proof from first principles — only involves basic notions and methods within the field without much development into the subject matter. For example:

- In linear algebra, the standard proof for the associativity of matrix multiplication is generally considered to be elementary — since it does not require much beyond some definitions and some borderline-tedious computations with summations.
- In real analysis, the standard proof of the intermediate value theorem  (i.e., one which relies on the completeness of real numbers) can be also regarded as elementary, since even if the approach is clever, it ultimately does not require extensive development into real analysis — or tapping into the methods of non-standard analysis.

On the other end of the spectrum, a proof which requires heavy mathematical machinery from multiple fields is typically referred to as a deep result, and would often be considered deep until an elementary proof is found.

## Eventually

A term used to indicate that an object doesn`t have a certain property across *all* its ordered instances, but which will be after some instances (countably or uncountably many) have passed. For example:

- The sequence $$n \mapsto \dfrac{3^n - 100}{4^n + 100}$$ is **eventually decreasing** (e.g., when $$n \ge 6$$).

- The function $$f(x)=2^x$$ will **eventually exceed** the function $$g(x)=x^{666}$$. 

- A sequence $$a_n$$ **converges** to $$L$$, if for all positive real numbers $$\epsilon$$, eventually \|$$a_n - L$$\| $$ < \epsilon$$.

- A function $$f(x)$$ is said to be in the **big-O** of another function $$g(x)$$, if there exists a positive real number $$M$$ such that eventually, \|$$f(x)$$\| $$ \le Mg(x)$$.

In general, the term "eventually" formalizes the **long-term behavior** of a mathematical object, and can be taken as a synonym of  when sufficiently large or "after some point". In fact, the point at which the property kicks in doesn`t even need to be known in advance — only that such a point does indeed exist.

## Exceptional Object

A rare object (usually finite in number) with some desirable property that makes it different from most objects of the same class (e.g., regular polygons, platonic solids). It’s also different from both well-behaved and pathological objects in that it is an exception rather than the rule that’s not pathological.

## Existence

A term used to assert the presence of an object satisfying a certain property, and is formalized using existential claims (i.e., claims of the form “there exists…”), and the existential quantifier ∃.

In general, to prove that an existential claim holds is to demonstrate, constructively or non-constructively, that object(s) with the property demanded in the claim exist — even though such objects might not be unique among those with the property.

## Finite

That whose quantity pertains to a natural number or a real number — which might or might not include zero or the infinitesimals. Some example uses of “finite” in mathematics include:

- Finite set
- Finite ring
- Finite graph
- Finite-dimensional vector space
- Finite area
- Finite variance
- Finite measure space

The opposite of finite is infinite, which — unlike the case with finite — is governed by a different set of arithmetical/operational rules (e.g., the first transfinite cardinal number $$\aleph_0$$ is such that $$\aleph_0 + 1000 = 574 \cdot \aleph_0 = \aleph_0 + \aleph_0 = \aleph_0 \cdot \aleph_0 = \aleph_0$$)

## Folklore

A term used to refer to an unpublished mathematical result with no clear originator, which is well-circulated and well-understood to be true or useful among the specialists, but which is less so among those who are less entrenched in the field. For example:

- A theorem that is folklore is known as a folk theorem.
- A set of mathematical knowledge (e.g., definitions, propositions, proofs, techniques) that is folklore is known as folk mathematics (e.g.,. the folklore of ring theory).

In general, a folklore claim is most often obtained through conferences and word of mouth, though if one chooses to publish it with all the write-up, then it would lose its folklore status as a result.

## Generalization

A form of abstraction where one goes from a set of simpler cases to higher-order instances, and can manifest in mathematical thinking in different ways (e.g., broadening the scope of a claim, solving a slightly more complex problem set). Some examples of generalization in mathematics include:

- Expanding the MacLaurin series into Taylor series
- Expanding the formula of  $$(x+y)^n$$ into the binomial formula of $$(x+y)^n$$

In general, generalization is both advantageous and disadvantageous, in that while it can make a claim less concrete and less visualizable, it can also make it more powerful and more applicable as a result.

## Global

A term used to indicate that a mathematical object satisfies a property across its entire object (e.g., global extremum, (global) uniform continuity, global topology, global cover). It is similar to the term “absolute”, and is to be contrasted with the term “local” — which is used to indicate that the property is only satisfied at some portions of the object.

## Heuristics

A series of general, trial-and-error-based strategies for solving mathematical problems which — while not necessarily optimal — can be cost-effective in yielding a satisfactory solution given the amount of invested time and effort. Some of most used heuristics in mathematics include:

- Giving a visual representation to a problem
- Making an assumption or a conjecture
- Reasoning forward and backward
- Making an educated guess (before refining the result)
- Solving a simplified, more concrete version of a problem

In general, heuristics and algorithms are similar in that both constitute some form of mathematical procedures, but are different in that the former prioritizes higher-order thinking over the actual steps — and as such might require a bit more mental flexibility and creativity.

On the other hand, a heuristic argument is generally one which — while pedagogically useful and seemingly convincing — makes a few key oversimplifications which disqualify it from a rigorous proof (e.g., establishing the derivative of $$f^{−1}(x)$$  by differentiating both sides of the equation $$f^{−1}(f(x))=x)$$. 

## Identity

A mathematical claim in the form of an equation — usually with some variables — which has been shown to be true for all values of the variables within a certain range of validity. Some examples of identities in mathematics include:

**Algebraic identities**
- $$(x+y)^4=x^4 + 4x^3y + 6x^2y^2 + 4xy^3 + y^4$$

**Combinatorial identities**
- Pascal’s rule

**Vector identities**
 - Lagrange’s identity

In abstract algebra, the term “identity” can be also used to denote an element which leaves all elements of a set invariant under some operation (e.g., additive identity, multiplicative identity).

## Indeterminate

A term typically used to refer to a mathematical expression capable of assuming multiple values, though its actual meaning is generally quite precise and dependent upon context. For example:

- In abstract algebra, an indeterminate is a variable used to generate mathematical elements and structures (e.g., polynomial ring $$[x,y]$$, formal power series).
- In algebra, an equation or a system of equations is called indeterminate — or underspecified — if it has multiple solutions.
- In analysis, the indeterminate forms are a series of mathematical expressions involving $$\infinity$$, 1 and 0 which are usually left undefined — because of their propensity to assume different limits (whenever they exist).

## Inequality

A mathematical statement which makes a non-equal comparison between two mathematical expressions, and which can be further categorized into the following three types:

- Loose inequality: when the comparison symbol is $$\le$$ or $$\ge$$.
- Strict inequality: when the comparison symbol is $$<$$ or $$>$$.
- Inequation: when the comparison symbol is $$\ne$$.

n general, inequalities tend to be in place when an equality cannot be readily established (or is otherwise inapplicable), and are quite often used to provide a sharp bound for some mathematical expression of interest. Some prominent inequalities in mathematics include:

- The triangle inequality
- Bernoulli’s inequality
- Cauchy-Schwartz inequality
- Markov’s inequality
- Chebyshev’s inequality
- Jensen’s inequality

## Infinite

An adjective used to refer to the general quality of being boundless (e.g., infinitely small, infinitely close), and is mostly used to describe an object whose quantity or limit is larger than any natural number or real number (e.g., infinite series, infinite length, infinite variance, infinitely-dimensional space).

In many scenarios, infinity is used solely as a concept (e.g., potential infinity as in infinite limits) rather than as an actual number (e.g., actual infinity), though it can also be formalized as actual numbers in the following two ways:

## In General

A term used to indicate that a generalization is under way. When used informally, it can be taken to mean “most” (e.g., “in general, integers are composite”), though in many scenarios, it is to be interpreted as “apply to all instances of a broader class” or “apply to all subcases in question”, as in:

> “Therefore, $$2n^3+3n^2+n$$ is divisible by $$6$$ in general.”

In some occasions, the phrase “in general” can also be found at the end of a proof (e.g., proof by induction, proof by cases) as a standard concluding remark.

## Intuition

A series of mathematical foresight, know-how and savviness that — while very difficult to pinpoint — allow one to “connect the dots” and tackle mathematical challenges more fruitfully with less wasted effort.

Despite its instinctive nature, mathematical intuition is often a product of accumulated knowledge and experience, and can be indicative of historical patterns and connections, as an anonymous mathematician puts on Quora:

> You are often confident that something is true long before you have an airtight proof for it (this happens especially often in geometry). The main reason is that you have a large catalogue of connections between concepts, and you can quickly intuit that if X were to be false, that would create tensions with other things you know to be true, so you are inclined to believe X is probably true to maintain the harmony of the conceptual space. It’s not so much that you can imagine the situation perfectly, but you can quickly imagine many other things that are logically connected to it.

Like rigor, intuition is often considered to be an integral part of mathematics, as it allows one to find the answer to a problem before solving it (a recurring theme in the history of mathematics), and helps imbue mathematics with a series of qualities that set it apart from some meaningless manipulations of symbols.

## Invariance

The property of a mathematical object to remain unchanged after an operation or a transformation. For example:

- A triangle is invariant under 3 rotations (as in the “swapping” of edges).
- An even function is invariant under reflection about y-axis.
- An angle is invariant under scaling.
- A symmetric matrix is invariant under matrix transposition.
- A determinant is invariant under “absorption” (i.e., the addition of a multiple of a row to another).
- The real part of a complex number is invariant under complex conjugation.
- A variance is invariant to linear changes in the random variable.

In geometry and other visually-based topics, invariance is often known under the name of symmetry (e.g., invariance under translation, scaling, reflection and rotation), though it can also occur in other topics such as algebra, topology, statistics, and discrete mathematics, and might even be regarded as a fundamental pattern of the mathematical universe.

## Lemma

A minor, relatively-easy-to-prove claim which is often used as a stepping stone for proving major results (e.g., the use of Euclid’s lemma in the proof of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic). For that reason, a lemma is also known as an “auxiliary theorem” or a “helping theorem” — even though it can also occasionally turn into a major result and take on a life of its own (e.g., Zorn’s lemma).

## Local

A term used to indicate that a mathematical object satisfies a property at some limited portions of the object — or from the point of view of some narrow, immediate surrounding. Some examples of local in mathematics include:

- Local extremum
- (Local) continuity
- Local view of surface
- Local flow
- Local topology
- Local solution
- Local optimum
- Local field

In general, the term “local” is similar in usage to the term “relative“, and is to be contrasted with the term “global” — which is used to indicate that the property is satisfied across the entire domain of interest.

## Mapping

A mapping, also known as a map, is simply a general function from a source to a target. The term originates from the idea of “mapping” each element of the source to a unique element in the target — such as the case of the function from $${1,2}$$ to $${2,3,4}$$ with $$1 \mapsto 2$$ and $$2 \mapsto 3$$.

Unlike a function — which can be interpreted as a term from analysis — the source and the target of a mapping doesn’t need to be related to numbers. As a result, a mapping might be known under different names depending on the context where it’s found (e.g., 
linear transformation, continuous map, morphism).

## Mathematical Maturity

The quality of having a general understanding and mastery of the way mathematicians operate — and the language they use to communicate ideas. These include, among others:

- The ability to identify and state mathematical patterns
- The ability to raise interesting mathematical questions
- The ability to carry out generalizations
- The ability to understand and make use of higher mathematical jargon
- The ability to make sound judgments on the quality and the validity of a proof
- The ability to think through the implications of a definition or a proposition
- The ability to fill in the preliminaries on one’s own
- The ability to construct and present a proof or a disproof of a typical claim

In general, mathematical maturity allows one to operate intellectually in an independent, standalone manner, and like mathematical intuition, can be a product of both knowledge and experience.

## Mathematical Representation

![Mathematical Representation](https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Pentagon-of-Math-Representations.png.webp "Mathematical Representation")

In mathematical education, a representation is one which encodes a mathematical idea or a relationship. It can occur as both internal (e.g., mental/cognitive construct) and external forms, and can be used to facilitate thinking, problem solving and communication in general. Some prominent examples of representation in mathematics include:

- Diagram
- Table
- Number line
- Arrangement
- Cartesian graph
- Physical model
- Spatial visualization
- Algebraic expression
- Verbal mnemonic

While representations can come in all shapes and forms, having multiple representations of the same mathematical idea (e.g., definitional vs. computational formula of variance, algebraic vs. combinatorial proof of Pascal’s rule) can still be very useful — as it allows one to tap into new insights and perspectives that might be hard to obtain otherwise.

## Mathematical Structure

A mathematical object consisting of a set along with some additional features on the set (e.g., operation, relation, metric, topology). Some eminent mathematical structures include, among others:

- The group of integer under addition (i.e., (Z,+))
- The partition of integers, as induced by the congruence relation with modulus 11
- The ordered field of real numbers (i.e., (R,+,×,<))
- The 3-dimensional Euclidean vector spaces with the taxicab metric

Across structures, certain mappings such as homomorphism and isomorphism allow one to categorize different structures as “similar” or “identical”, and since structures often lie at the root of mathematics, the study of structures can also reveal fundamental patterns that are transferable or generalizable to other fields.

## Natural

An occasionally-informal substitute for the term “canonical“, that generally has very little to do with nature. Aside from its occurrences in the common mathematical parlance (e.g., natural number, natural logarithm), it’s generally used to describe a transformation whose description holds independently of choices (e.g., natural transformation).

Unlike canonical, what’s designated as natural is often not unique — if not loosely defined. Though in some occasions, both terms could indeed be used interchangeably (e.g., canonical vs. natural map).

## Null

An adjective frequently associated with the concept of “nothing“, though it’s usually attached to a noun to mean something more specific. For example:

- A null element is an element that generalizes the concept of zero (e.g., null matrix).
- A null vector is the vector of length 0 (among other meanings).
- A null set is the set with no element (among other meanings).
- A null space of a linear mapping — also known as a kernel — is the set of vectors which map to the null vector under that mapping.
- A null hypothesis is the status quo hypothesis that there’s nothing significantly different happening, and is one which is presumed to be true until proven otherwise.

## One-to-One

![One-to-One](https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Injective-Function.png.webp "One-to-One")

The quality of a function to map distinct elements in the domain to distinct elements in the codomain (e.g., the real-valued function defined by the assignment $$x \mapsto 2x+1$$). In which case, the mapping is also known as an injective function — or an injection for short.

From a set theory standpoint, if a mapping from A to B is one-to-one, then the “size” of B is at least as large as that of A. By removing the unmapped elements in the codomain, one can also transform a one-to-one function into a one-to-one correspondence as well.

## Proof by Brute Force

An extreme form of proof by cases — where a claim is proved by breaking it down into all the possible cases in great detail (e.g., the first computer-assisted proof of the four color theorem in 1976).

While such an approach constitutes a perfectly legitimate method for proving a claim, it can also sometimes be considered as the antithesis of elegance — and might even reflect a lack of personal and collective understanding on the subject matter.

## Proof by Contradiction

An indirect method of proof that attempts to prove a claim by proving that the opposite will lead to a contradiction. For that reason, the method is also known as “reductio ad absurdum” — or “reduction to absurdity” in Latin.

A celebrated example used to illustrate the inner working of proof by contradiction involves the proof of the irrationality of 2−−√, where one is taken from the initial assumption that 2–√ can be expressed as a ratio of two co-prime integers — to the ultimate conclusion that the said integers are actually not coprime after all.

When occurred in texts, a proof by contradiction is usually prefaced by clauses such as “by way of contradiction” (BWOC), “suppose not” and its variants. It is not to be confused with proof by contraposition, which is similarly indirect but involves no contradiction at all.

## Proof by Example

- A humorous term used to refer to an argument which attempts to illustrate the validity of a claim through cases and examples — rather than a full-fledged proof. For example, one might say that:

> “Since 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17… are all odd, all prime numbers must be odd.”

In many cases, a “proof by example” is itself an example of a logical fallacy, though there are at least 2 cases where that might not apply:

- The claim is such that it only requires a small amount of examples to be proved (e.g., existential claim).
- The “proof” actually does contain the key ideas needed to generalize it into a full-fledged proof.

For other similar “proof techniques” that could be potentially fallacious, see hand-waving and proof by intimidation.

## Proof by Induction

![Induction](https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Induction-and-Domino-300x330.png.webp "Induction")

A proof technique employed to show that a claim holds for all natural numbers (or any other set that is inductively defined), and which typically involves the following two steps:

- Base case: Showing that the claim holds for a minimal instance (e.g., proposition P(n) holds when n=1).
- Inductive case: Showing that by assuming that the claim holds for an arbitrary instance (i.e., inductive hypothesis), one can deduce that the claim will also hold for the next instance (e.g., P(n)⟹P(n+1) for all n∈N).

In general, a standard inductive proof (i.e., weak induction) is useful in that it reduces the proof of infinitely many instances into two steps. By modifying the standard induction slightly, it is also possible to use induction to prove claims of a different form as well (e.g., strong induction, reverse induction, prefix induction, multi-variate induction, structural induction, transfinite induction).

## Singularity

A point at which a mathematical object — such as an equation or a surface — ceases to be well-behaved and deviates from its usual behaviors.

## Smooth

An adjective used mostly to refer to a function or an equation with no singularity. 

## Transformation

![Transformation](https://mathvault.ca/wp-content/uploads/Rotation-and-Transformation-389x400.png.webp "Transformation")

An invertible mapping from a set to itself (usually R2 or R3) with some salient geometrical underpinning, and which is often describable using vectors or matrices. Some prominent transformations in mathematics include:

- Translation
- Reflection
- Rotation
- Scaling
- Shearing

In the wider context, a transformation may also be used to refer to a general mapping — irrespective of its nature and domain/codomain.
