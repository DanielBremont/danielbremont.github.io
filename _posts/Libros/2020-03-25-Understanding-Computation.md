<!--Resumen-->

If you're insterested in the mind-expanding parts of computer science that deal with programs, languages, and machines, but are discouraged by the mathematical language that's often used to explain then, this book is for you. Instead of complex notation we'll 
use working code to illustrate theoretical ideas and turn them into interactive experiments that you can explore at your own pace.

- Just Enough Ruby
- The Meaning of Programs
- The Simplest Computers
- Just Add Power
- The Ultimate Machine
- Programming with Nothing
