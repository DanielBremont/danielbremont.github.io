<!--Resumen-->
Data scientifs has been called "the sexiest job of 21st century" presumably by someone who has never visited a fire station. Nonetheless, data science is a host and growing field, and it doesn't take a great deal of sleuthing to  find analyts breathlessly prognosticating that over the next 10 years, we'll need billions and billions more data scients than we currently have.

The goal of this book is to help you develop the hacking skills that you'll need to get started doign data science.
