<!--Resumen-->
The idea of this book is to study one idea in detail, the idea that ordinary thinking as performed by people
might be undertood as a form of computation. We explore the connection between thinking and computing by examining  what
it takes to program a computer to preform certain taks that seem t require thought. A secondary goal is to learn a certain type of a computer programming in a language called Prolog.
