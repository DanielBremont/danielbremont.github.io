Abstract

In 1985 Luca Cardeli and Peter Wegner, my advisor, published an ACM Computing Surveys paper called "On undertanding types, data abstraction, and polymorphism". Their work kicked off a flood of research on semantics and type theory for object-oriented programming, which continues to his day. Despide 25 years of research, there is still widespread confusion about the two forms of data abstraction, abstract data types and objects. This essay attemps to explain the differences and also why the differences matter.
