[Learning organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_organization)

In business management, a learning organization is a company that facilitates the learning of its members and continuously transforms itself. The concept was coined through the work and research of Peter Senge and his colleagues.

Learning organizations develop as a result of the pressures facing modern organizations; this enables them to remain competitive in the business environment.
