[Quantifying Productivity](http://karpathy.github.io/2014/08/03/quantifying-productivity/)

I’m always on a lookout for interesting datasets to collect, analyze and interpret. And what better dataset to collect/analyze than the meta-dataset of my own activity collecting/analyzing other datasets? How much time do I *really spend working per day? How do I spend most of that time? What makes me productive? These are all relatively important questions that I’d like answers to, and since I prefer my answers based on data and not confirmation-bias-susceptible personal anecdotes, I wrote [ulogme](https://github.com/karpathy/ulogme).
