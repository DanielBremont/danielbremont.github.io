[Quantifying Productivity](http://karpathy.github.io/2014/08/03/quantifying-productivity/)

I’m always on a lookout for interesting datasets to collect, analyze and interpret. And what better dataset to collect/analyze than the meta-dataset of my own activity collecting/analyzing other datasets? How much time do I *really spend working per day? How do I spend most of that time? What makes me productive? These are all relatively important questions that I’d like answers to, and since I prefer my answers based on data and not confirmation-bias-susceptible personal anecdotes, I wrote [ulogme](https://github.com/karpathy/ulogme).

If You Commit to Nothing, You’ll Be Distracted By Everythin
In the northeastern hills outside Kyoto, Japan there is a mountain known as Mount Hiei. That mountain is littered with unmarked graves.

Those graves mark the final resting place of the Tendai Buddhist monks who have failed to complete a quest known as the Kaihogyo.

For the past few years, Anki has acted as my digital storage (albeit, imperfect). If I look something up in StackOverflow, I’ll add it to Anki. Wikipedia? Another Anki card. It’s probably the one thing I most attribute to helping my software engineering career. My total deck recently passed ten thousand cards. In this guide, I’ll explain the avoidable (dumb) mistakes, but also provide the effective strategies I found along the way. This Anki guide assumes the reader is familiar with these topics:

The Personal Analytics of My Life
The Personal Analytics of My Life

One day I’m sure everyone will routinely collect all sorts of data about themselves. But because I’ve been interested in data for a very long time, I started doing this long ago. I actually assumed lots of other people were doing it too, but apparently they were not. And so now I have what is probably one of the world’s largest collections of personal data.
