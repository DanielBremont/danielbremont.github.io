[The Orbit OS Precepts](https://urbit.org/blog/precepts/)

Urbit is a principled approach to system design and programming, but it's often not obvious what those principles are. We have many specific terms for the different parts of the project: Arvo is the OS, Hoon is the language, Tlon is the company, Azimuth is the identity system, Ames is the network. But the word most associated with the project is "Urbit", and it's not clear what technically it refers to. It's only a small stretch to say that "Urbit" is this set of principles, and that if anybody follows these principles strictly they will create a system that is isomorphic to the Urbit.
