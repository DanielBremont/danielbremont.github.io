[How a 2 person startup already uses 28 other tools](https://blog.acrossapp.com/how-a-2-person-startup-already-uses-28-other-tools/)

At Across, we wanted to see how many other technology companies and service providers we use on a regular basis. The answer was way more than we thought. For a seed stage 2 person startup, we already use 28 different tools regularly totaling $227 / month (we’re on the free plans for many of them). And, this excludes libraries in our product. It’s self-inflicted, but a lot of tools nonetheless.
