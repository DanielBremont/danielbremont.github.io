## Write a rapid prototype first

Discovering a solution to a mathematical problem is only half of the battle.  Actually writing down the argument that you’ve discovered formally can also be a daunting task, especially if the argument is lengthy and is not modeled on an existing one in the literature. While every individual detail of the argument may be clear to the author, the overall structure of the argument may not be immediately obvious. In particular, it is often difficult to make the (important) decisions about the organisation of the argument, and selection of good notation, until a large part of the paper is already written, at which point any changes in the organisation or in the notation often become painful to implement. (Many times in the past, I have started to write a paper without devoting enough thought to the overall structure, and spent a lot of time establishing some lemmas which I thought were important, only to realise later that one did not actually need the lemma, thus wasting quite a lot of time.)
