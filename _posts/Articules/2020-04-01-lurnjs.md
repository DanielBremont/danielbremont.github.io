### Jekyll search using lunr.js

[Jekyll search using lunr.js](https://learn.cloudcannon.com/jekyll/jekyll-search-using-lunr-js/)

#### Introducción

We’re adding search to the demo Bakery Store site so users can easily find relevant content. It’s a relatively small site so we can perform the search entirely client side. If there were hundreds of blog posts, performing the search client side may get slow and a backend search may be a better option.
