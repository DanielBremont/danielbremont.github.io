[160+ Data Science Interview Questions](https://hackernoon.com/160-data-science-interview-questions-415s3y2a)

A typical interview process for a data science position includes multiple rounds. Often, one of such rounds covers theoretical concepts, where the goal is to determine if the candidate knows the fundamentals of machine learning.

In this post, I’d like to summarize all my interviewing experience  —  from both interviewing and being interviewed  —  and came up with a list of 160+ theoretical data science questions.

This includes the following topics:

- Linear regression
- Validation
- Classification and logistic regression
- Regularization
- Decision trees
- Random forest
- Gradient boosting trees
- Neural networks
- Text classification
- Clustering
- Ranking: search and recommendation
- Time series
