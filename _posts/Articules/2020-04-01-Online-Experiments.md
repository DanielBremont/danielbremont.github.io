[The Surprising Power of Online Experiments](https://hbr.org/2017/09/the-surprising-power-of-online-experiments/)

In 2012 a Microsoft employee working on Bing had an idea about changing the way the search engine displayed ad headlines. Developing it wouldn’t require much effort—just a few days of an engineer’s time—but it was one of hundreds of ideas proposed, and the program managers deemed it a low priority. So it languished for more than six months, until an engineer, who saw that the cost of writing the code for it would be small, launched a simple online controlled experiment—an A/B test—to assess its impact. Within hours the new headline variation was producing abnormally high revenue, triggering a “too good to be true” alert. Usually, such alerts signal a bug, but not in this case. An analysis showed that the change had increased revenue by an astonishing 12%—which on an annual basis would come to more than $100 million in the United States alone—without hurting key user-experience metrics. It was the best revenue-generating idea in Bing’s history, but until the test its value was underappreciated.

[Beyond A/B Testing: Primer on Causal Inference](https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-a-b-testing-primer-on-causal-inference-d8e462d90a0b)


Applied statistics is seeing rapid adoption of Pearlian causality and Bayesian statistics, which closely mimic how humans learn about the world. Certainly, increased computational power and accessible tools have contributed to their popularity. The real appeal, however, is much more fundamental:

- interpretability. We can communicate using diagrams and plain language. (Have you tried explaining a p-value to a non-technical audience?)

- collaboration. These frameworks require expert judgment. The interpretability makes it easier to involve others.

- relevance. Business questions are better answered under these frameworks.
