[Session replay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_replay)

Session replay is the ability to replay a visitor's journey on a web site or within a mobile application or web application. Replay can include the user's view (browser or screen output), user input (keyboard and mouse inputs), and logs of network events or console logs. It is supposed to help improve customer experience[1] and to identify obstacles in conversion processes on websites. However it can also be used to study web site usability and customer behavior as well as handling customer service questions as the customer journey with all interactions can be replayed. Some organizations even use this capability to analyse fraudulent behavior on websites.
