[How to deliver on Machine Learning projects](https://mlpowered.com/posts/how-to-deliver-on-machine-learning-projects/)

As Machine Learning (ML) is becoming an important part of every industry, the demand for Machine Learning Engineers (MLE) has grown dramatically. MLEs combine machine learning skills with software engineering knowhow to find high-performing models for a given application and handle the implementation challenges that come up — from building out training infrastructure to preparing models for deployment. New online resources have sprouted in parallel to train engineers to build ML models and solve the various software challenges encountered. However, one of the most common hurdles with new ML teams is maintaining the same level of forward progress that engineers are accustomed to with traditional software engineering.

### Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning

Automating the end-to-end lifecycle of Machine Learning applications

Machine Learning applications are becoming popular in our industry, however the process for developing, deploying, and continuously improving them is more complex compared to more traditional software, such as a web service or a mobile application. They are subject to change in three axis: the code itself, the model, and the data. Their behaviour is often complex and hard to predict, and they are harder to test, harder to explain, and harder to improve. Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning (CD4ML) is the discipline of bringing Continuous Delivery principles and practices to Machine Learning applications.
