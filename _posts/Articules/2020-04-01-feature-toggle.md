[Feature Toggles (aka Feature Flags)](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html)

"Feature Toggling" is a set of patterns which can help a team to deliver new functionality to users rapidly but safely. In this article on Feature Toggling we'll start off with a short story showing some typical scenarios where Feature Toggles are helpful. Then we'll dig into the details, covering specific patterns and practices which will help a team succeed with Feature Toggles.

Feature Toggles are also refered to as Feature Flags, Feature Bits, or Feature Flippers. These are all synonyms for the same set of techniques. Throughout this article I'll use feature toggles and feature flags interchangebly.
