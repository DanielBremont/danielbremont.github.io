### Linux Performance Analysis in 60,000 Milliseconds

[Linux Performance Analysis in 60,000 Milliseconds](https://netflixtechblog.com/linux-performance-analysis-in-60-000-milliseconds-accc10403c55)

There are an amazing number of things you need to know to be a proficient programmer — details of languages, APIs, algorithms, data structures, systems and tools.

It is important to stay current and proficient. A carpenter needs to know how to pick the right hammer and nail for the job and needs to be competent at driving the nail straight and true.
