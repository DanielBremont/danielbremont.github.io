### Information overload

[Information overload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload)

Information overload (also known as infobesity,[1] infoxication,[2] information anxiety,[3] and information explosion[4]) is the difficulty in understanding an issue and effectively making decisions when one has too much information about that issue.[5] Generally, the term is associated with the excessive quantity of daily information. Information overload most likely originated from information theory, which are studies in the storage, preservation, communication, compression, and extraction of information. The term, information overload, was first used in Bertram Gross' 1964 book, The Managing of Organizations,[6] and it was further popularized by Alvin Toffler in his bestselling 1970 book Future Shock.[7] Speier et al. (1999) stated:

Information overload occurs when the amount of input to a system exceeds its processing capacity. Decision makers have fairly limited cognitive processing capacity. Consequently, when information overload occurs, it is likely that a reduction in decision quality will occur.
