[Design Principles Behind Smalltalk](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/smalltalk.html)

The purpose of the Smalltalk project is to provide computer support for the creative spirit in everyone. Our work flows from a vision that includes a creative individual and the best computing hardware available. We have chosen to concentrate on two principle areas of research: a language of description (programming language) that serves as an interface between the models in the human mind and those in computing hardware, and a language of interaction (user interface) that matches the human communication system to that of the computer. Our work has followed a two- to four-year cycle that can be seen to parallel the scientific method:

- Build an application program within the current system (make an observation)
- Based on that experience, redesign the language (formulate a theory)
- Build a new system based on the new design (make a prediction that can be tested)
