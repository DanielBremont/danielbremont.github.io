[How to dockerize any application](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-dockerize-any-application-b60ad00e76da)

A 10-steps checklist on how to dockerize any application.

There are already many tutorials on how to dockerize applications available on the internet, so why I am writing another one?

Most of the tutorials I see are focused on a specific technology (say Java or Python) which may not cover what you need. They also do not address all the relevant aspects that are necessary to establish a well defined contract between Dev and Ops teams (which is what containerization is all about).
