Alist of ideas, in no particular order and from different fields, that help explain how the world works:


- **Skill Compensation**: People who are exceptionally good at one thing tend to be exceptionally poor at another.

- **Curse of Knowledge**: The inability to communicate your ideas because you wrongly assume others have the necessary background to understand what you’re talking about.

- **Base Rates**: The success rate of everyone who’s done what you’re about to try.

- **Pareto Principle**: The majority of outcomes are driven by a minority of events.

- **Sturgeon’s Law**: “90% of everything is crap.” The obvious inverse of the Pareto Principle, but hard to accept in practice.

- **Cumulative advantage**: Social status snowballs in either direction because people like associating with successful people, so doors are opened for them, and avoid associating with unsuccessful people, for whom doors are closed.

- **Impostor Syndrome**: Fear of being exposed as less talented than people think you are, often because talent is owed to cumulative advantage rather than actual effort or skill.

- **McNamara Fallacy**: A belief that rational decisions can be made with quantitative measures alone, when in fact the things you can’t measure are often the most consequential. Named after Defense Secretary McNamara, who [tried to quantify](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/immeasurably-important/) every aspect of the Vietnam War.

- **Berkson’s Paradox**: Strong correlations can fall apart when combined with a larger population. Among hospital patients, motorcycle crash victims wearing helmets are more likely to be seriously injured than those not wearing helmets. But that’s because most crash victims saved by helmets did not need to become hospital patients, and those without helmets are more likely to die before becoming a hospital patient.

- **Ludic Fallacy**: Falsely associated simulations with real life. Nassim Taleb: “Organized competitive fighting trains the athlete to focus on the game and, in order not to dissipate his concentration, to ignore the possibility of what is not specifically allowed by the rules, such as kicks to the groin, a surprise knife, et cetera. So those who win the gold medal might be precisely those who will be most vulnerable in real life.”

- **Actor-Observer Asymmetry**: We judge others based solely on their actions, but when judging ourselves we have an internal dialogue that justifies our mistakes and bad decisions.

- **Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy**: Goals set retroactively after an activity, like shooting a blank wall and then drawing a bullseye around the holes you left, or picking a benchmark after you’ve invested.

- **Golem Effect**: Performance declines when supervisors/teachers have low expectations of your abilities.

- **Behavioral Inevitability**: “History never repeats itself; man always does.” – Voltaire

- **Apophenia**: A tendency to perceive correlations between unrelated things, because your mind can only deal with tiny sample sizes and assuming things are correlated creates easy/comforting explanations of how the world works.

- **Hanlon’s Razor**: “Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.”

- **Cobra Effect**: Attempting to solve a problem makes that problem worse. Comes from an Indian story about a city infested with snakes offering a bounty for every dead cobra, which caused entrepreneurs to start breeding cobras for slaughter.

- **Non-Ergodic**: When group probabilities don’t apply to singular events. If 100 people play Russian Roulette once, the odds of dying might be, say, 10%. But if one person plays Russian Roulette 100 times, the odds are dying are practically 100%.

- **Pollyanna Principle**: It’s easier to remember happy memories than bad ones.

- **Declinism**: Perpetually viewing society as in decline, because you’re afflicted by the Pollyanna Principle and you forget how much things sucked in the past.

- **Collective Narcissism**: Exaggerating the importance and influence of your social group (country, industry, company, department, etc.).

- **Feedback Loops**: Falling stock prices scare people, which cause them to sell, which makes prices fall, which scares more people, which causes more people to sell, and so on. Works both ways.

- **Hawthorne Effect**: Being watched/studied changes how people behave, making it difficult to conduct social studies that accurately reflect the real world.

- **Hormesis**: Something that hurts you in a high dose can be good for you in small doses. (Weight on your bones, drinking red wine, etc.)

- **Reflexivity**: When cause and effect are the same. People think Tesla will sell a lot of cars, so Tesla stock goes up, which lets Tesla raise a bunch of new capital, which helps Tesla sell a lot of cars.

- **Friendship Paradox**: On average, people have fewer friends than their friends have. Occurs because people with an abnormally high number of friends are more likely to be one of your friends. It’s a fundamental part of social network dynamics and makes most people feel less popular than they are.

- **Bizarreness Effect**: Crazy things are easier to remember than common things, providing a distorted sense of “normal.”

- **Nonlinearity**: Outputs aren’t always proportional to inputs, so the world is a barrage of massive wins and horrible losses that surprise people.

- **Denomination Effect**: One hundred $1 bills feels like less money than one $100 bill. Also explains stock splits – buying 10 shares for $10 each feels cheaper than one share for $100.

- **Woozle Effect**: “A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth.” - Daniel Kahneman

- **Google Scholar Effect**: Scientific research depends on citing other research, and the research that gets cited the most is whatever shows up in the top results of Google Scholar searches, regardless of its contribution to the field.

- **Inversion**: Avoiding problems can be more important than scoring wins.

- **Dunning-Kruger Effect**: Knowing the limits of your intelligence requires a certain level of intelligence, so some people are too stupid to know how stupid they are.

- **Focusing Effect**: Overemphasizing factors that seem important but exist as part of a complex system. People from the Midwest assume Californians are happier because the weather is better, but they’re not because Californians also deal with traffic, bad bosses, unhappy marriages, etc, which more than offset the happiness boost from sunny skies.

- **Founder’s Syndrome**: When a CEO is so emotionally invested in a company that they can’t effectively delegate decisions.

- **Bounded Rationality**: People can’t be fully rational because your brain is a hormone machine, not an Excel spreadsheet.

- **Luxury Paradox**: The more expensive something is the less likelys you are to use it, so the relationship between price and utility is an inverted U. Ferraris sit in garages; Hondas get driven.

- **Meat Paradox**: Dogs are family, pigs are food. Some animals classified as food are wrongly perceived to have lower intelligence than those classified as pets. An example of morality depending on utility.

- **Fluency Heuristic**: Ideas that can be explained simply are more likely to be believed than those that are complex, even if the simple-sounding ideas are nonsense. It occurs because ideas that are easy to grasp are hard to distinguish from ideas you’re familiar with.

- **Goodhart's law**: [Ir youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwcK7NI_i98&feature=emb_logo){:target="_blank"}
    - When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.
    - Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes.
    - Metric manipulation
