### Introduction to architecting systems for scale

[Introduction to architecting systems for scale](https://lethain.com/introduction-to-architecting-systems-for-scale/)

Few computer science or software development programs attempt to teach the building blocks of scalable systems. Instead, system architecture is usually picked up on the job by working through the pain of a growing product or by working with engineers who have already learned through that suffering process.

### You can't reason about big balls of mud

[You can't reason about big balls of mud](https://lethain.com/reasoning-about-big-balls-of-mud/)

One of the smartest engineers I worked with couldn't finish projects. Forward progress was always a struggle. They saw the problem. They saw a related problem. They uncovered surrounding problems. Eventually the task became insurmountable. I got frustrated. How could they be endlessly enveloped by small problems?

### Developing service oriented architectures

(Developing service oriented architectures)[https://lethain.com/lessons-from-developing-software-oriented-architectures/]

After spending the last four years rolling out and maintaining (service oriented architectures)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture], it's my hope that I've accumulated enough scars on the topic to approximate wisdom. This is an attempt to share some useful tidbits.

First I'll briefly describe the two different SOAs I've been working on to provide some context, and then launch into the lessons I've learned and observations I've made.

Building scalable system is becoming a hotter and hotter topic. Mainly because more and more people are using computer these days, both the transaction volume and their performance expectation has grown tremendously.

Looking back after 2.5 years since my previous post on scalable system design techniques, I've observed an emergence of a set of commonly used design patterns. Here is my attempt to capture and share them.

### Modern Software Over-Engineering Mistakes

[Modern Software Over-Engineering Mistakes](https://medium.com/@rdsubhas/10-modern-software-engineering-mistakes-bc67fbef4fc8#.da6dvzyne)

Few things are guaranteed to increase all the time: Distance between stars, Entropy in the visible universe, and Fucking business requirements . Many articles say Dont over-engineer but donâ€™t say why or how. Here are 10 clear examples.
