* Notes on The Legacy of Computer Science acordding Gerald J. Sussman 

<!--more-->

* A programming is an idea about a methodology(At least an algorithm).

* COmputer Programs : Express what we do, and how we do it, express our ideas.

* Marvin MInsky : Why programming is a good medium for expressing poorly-understood and  sloppy-formulated ideas.

* Computer Science (Revolution in the Way we think!)

* Euclide - Take the existing knolwdge, and describe that knolwdge using an axiomatic language, he formalize geometry.

* FOr beign smaters, know for languages constructs, and undertand them..
* So knolwdge gives you inteligence. And the application ot it!
* ALgebra : Recombinaing the broken parts.

* Algebra is a languaje, for expressing knowledge (declarative).
* Astronomy : Has a language, is a language,has word, expressions(sentences) that are evaluated to true or false.

* Formalize knolwdge, allows teaching that knoledge so in that way the man kind gets more intelligence.

* A language allows to increase the hability to express ourselves.

* Every language gives you : expresiones primitivas y datos, sus sentencinas(statements or declarations).
	
* Means of abstraction.
	
* Means of combinations.

* Susman ha estado pensando hace mucho tiempo sobre como expresar el conocimineto, de una forma facil de comprender por las demas
  personas.

* Por ejemplo como diseñar programas de computadoras. (Diseño, expecification de los objetos computacionales, modulos, etc.)
* Method for solving every problem :
 Plan :
	* Do I know the answer of the problem ?
         
* If the answer is yes, we are done.
	
* Can I breake the problem using a known decomposition?
		
* if so:
			
* Solve each sub-problem.
			
* Create a create final soluton (whole), combining (some how), the solution of the parts.
			
* then test the solution of the original problem (the whole), lo resolvistes o no.
			if yes (We are done)
			if not (trata de describir la diferencia entre tus resultados y los esperados)
		        
* SOlves  a new sub-problem : make a modification to the solution that eliminates de difference.
	
* Can I change the representation of the problem (so i can see it in other way).
	
* Program Design defines the arquitectue or scheleton of the projects.
* craftsman (artesano - sabio)

* What is the relation with analysis and syntesys with computer programming :
  - Analysis : Break down the problems in sub-problems. Solve each sub-problem.
  - Syntexis : Recombine the solutions to the sub-problems, and solve the larger problem. Syntexis very creacity activity.
  - It can be see, easly with recursive problems(natural recursive problems).

* Relatio of computer programming with synsttesis and creativity :
  * You got a problem, divide in to sub-problems , the analysis parts.
  * Recombine the solutions of every subproblems, (use creativity) and what you get is the solution of the larger problem. Syntexis.
  * So when programming first do the analysys fase, then do the syntexis fase.

* Relation of computer programming with algebra :
  * Algebra the reunion(combination) of broken parts.
  * Computer Programing  : We broke the problems, solve each peace independetly, and then recombine the broken parts.
  * Both describe knolwdge.

* Does a program describe knolege?
 * If the program is a descriptio of a representatino of an algorithm, yes it its.
