# Preface

The field of high performance scientific computing lies at the crossroads of a number of disciplines and
skill sets, and correspondingly, for someone to be successful at using high performance computing in science requires at least elementary knowledge of and skills in all these areas. Computations stem from an
application context, so some acquaintance with physics and engineering sciences is desirable. Then, problems in these application areas are typically translated into linear algebraic, and sometimes combinatorial,
problems, so a computational scientist needs knowledge of several aspects of numerical analysis, linear
algebra, and discrete mathematics. An efficient implementation of the practical formulations of the application problems requires some understanding of computer architecture, both on the CPU level and on the
level of parallel computing. Finally, in addition to mastering all these sciences, a computational scientist
needs some specific skills of software management.

While good texts exist on numerical modeling, numerical linear algebra, computer architecture, parallel
computing, performance optimization, no book brings together these strands in a unified manner. The need
for a book such as the present became apparent to the author working at a computing center: users are
domain experts who not necessarily have mastery of all the background that would make them efficient
computational scientists. This book, then, teaches those topics that seem indispensible for scientists engaging in large-scale computations.

The contents of this book are a combination of theoretical material and self-guided tutorials on various
practical skills. The theory chapters have exercises that can be assigned in a classroom, however, their
placement in the text is such that a reader not inclined to do exercises can simply take them as statement of
fact.

The tutorials should be done while sitting at a computer. Given the practice of scientific computing, they
have a clear Unix bias.
