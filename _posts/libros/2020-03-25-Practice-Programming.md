<!--Resumen-->

This book is based on these underlying, interrelated principles, which apply at all levels of computing. These include simplicity, which keeps programs  short and manageable; **clarity**, which makes sure they are easy to unsertand, for people as well as machines; **generaility**, which means they work well in a broad range of situatiosn and adapt well as new situations arise; and **automation**, which lets the machine do the work for us, freeing us from mundane tasks. By looking at the computer programming in a variety of languages, from algorihtms and data structures though design, debugging, testing, and performace improvement, we can illustrade universal enginnering concepts that are independent of language, operative system, or programming paradigm.
