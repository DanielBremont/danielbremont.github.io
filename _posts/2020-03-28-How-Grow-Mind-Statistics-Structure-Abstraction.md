Abstract

In comming to undertand the world  in learning concepts, acquiring language, and grasping causal relations our minds make inferences that appear to go far beyond the data aviable. 
How do we do it? This review describe recent approaches to reverse-engineering more humanlike machine learning systems. Computational models that perform probabilistic inference over hierarchies of flexibly structued representations can address some of the deepest questiosn abuot the nature and origins of human thought: How does abstract knowlege guide learning and reasoning from sparse data? What froms does our knowledge take,  across different domains ask tasks? And how is that abstract knoledge itself acquired?
