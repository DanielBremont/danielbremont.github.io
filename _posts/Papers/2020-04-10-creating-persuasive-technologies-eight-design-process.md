# Abstract

This paper outlines eight steps to follow as best practices in the early stages of persuasive technology design. The eight-step process, drawn from demonstrated successes in industry practice, begins with defining the persuasion goal to match a target audience with an appropriate technology channel. Subsequent steps include imitating successful examples of persuasive design, performing rapid trials, measuring behavioral outcomes, and building on small successes.
