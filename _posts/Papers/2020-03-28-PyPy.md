Introduction

Python is a high-level, dynamic programming language. It was invented by the Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum 
in the late 1980s. Guido's original implementation is a traditional bycode interpreter written in C, and consequently kown as CPython. THere are now many other Python implementations. Among the most notable are Jython, which is written in Java and allows for interfacing with Java code, IronPython, which is written in C# and interfaces with Microsoft's .NET framework,  and PyPy, the subject of this chapter. CPython is still the most widely used implemntation and currently the in PyPy that make it different from other Python implementatino and indeed fro many other dynamic language implementation.
