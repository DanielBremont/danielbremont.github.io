Abstract

Simpson's paradox if often presented as a compelling demostration of why we need statistics education in our shools.
It is a remainder of how easy it is to fall into a web of paradoxcal conclusions when relying solely on intuition, unaided by rigorous statistical tors began using it to demostrate the limits of statistical methods, and why causal, rather than statistical considerations are necessary to avoid those paradoxical conclusions.

In this note, my comments are divided into two parts. First, I will give a brief summary  of the history of Simpson's paradox and how it has been treated in the statistical literature in the past century. Next I will ask what is required to declare the paradox "resolved", and argue that modern undertanding of causal inference has met those requirements.
