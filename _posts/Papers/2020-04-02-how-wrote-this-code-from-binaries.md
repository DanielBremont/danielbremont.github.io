## Abstract

Program authorship attribution—identifying a programmer based on stylistic characteristics of code—has practical implications for detecting software theft, digital forensics, and malware analysis. Authorship attribution is challenging in these domains where usually only binary code is available; existing source code-based approaches to attribution have left unclear whether and to what extent programmer style survives the compilation process. Casting authorship attribution as a machine learning problem, we present a novel program representation and techniques that automatically detect the stylistic features of binary code. We apply these techniques to two attribution problems: identifying the precise author of a program, and finding stylistic similarities between programs by unknown authors. Our experiments provide strong evidence that programmer style is preserved in program binaries.
