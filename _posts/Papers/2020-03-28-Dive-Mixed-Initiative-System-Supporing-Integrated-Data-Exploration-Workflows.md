Abstract:

Generating knowledge from data is an increasingly importatnt activity. 
This process of data exploration consists of multiple tasks:
- data ingestion
- visualization
- statistical analysis
- storytelling.
Though these tasks are complementary, analysts often execute them in separte tools. Moreover, thee tools have steep learning curves due to their reliance on manual query specification. Here, we de-scrube the design and implementation of DIVE,  a web-based system that integrates state-of-the-art data exploration features into a single tool. DIVE contributes a mixed-initiative interaction scheme that combines recommendation with point-and-click manual specification, and a consistent visual languge that unifies different stages of the data exploration workflow. In a controlled user study with 67 professional data scientists, we find that DIVE users were significantly more sucessful and faster than Excel users at completing predefined data visualization and analysis tasks.
