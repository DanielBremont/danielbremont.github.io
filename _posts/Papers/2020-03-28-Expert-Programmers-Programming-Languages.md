Abstract

This paper contrasts cusorily the aspiratiosn of general-purpose programming language designers with some evidence about expert problem solving and programming behavior. The contrast is summarized in a rough wish list of what experts want from general-purpose programming languages. The programmers whish list differs from the aspiratiosn of language designers less in detail than in emphahis: whereas the designers emphasize well-foundedness and correctness, the expert programeers emphasize utility, control and efficienty. It is argued that a programming language is a tool, not a panacea; tools make easy the tasks for which they are designed, but the outcome depends on the intention and expertise of the wielder.
