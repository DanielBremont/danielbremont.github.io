Abstract

There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data.
One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechasism as unknown. The statistical community has been commiteted to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitent 
has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has develop rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. IF our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then  we need to move ways from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.
