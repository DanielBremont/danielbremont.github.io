Abstract

Using the arithmetic mean to summarize normalized bechmark results leas to mistaken conclusions that can be avoided by using the preferred method: the geometric mean.

In the literature, performace results are frequently summarized usng the arithmetic mean of performace
retios, leading, in some cases, to wrong conclusions. We hope to elucidate this inadvertent misuse of statistics in reporting results by pointing out why the arithmetic mean should not be used to summarize normalized performace numbers, and showing why the geometric mean is the more appropiate measure. We do this in the form of some simple rules for improved statistical analysis of performace bechnmark results.
