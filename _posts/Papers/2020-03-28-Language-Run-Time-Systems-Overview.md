Abstract

The profiferation of high-level programmin glanguages with advanced language features and the need for portability across increasingly heterogenous and heirarchical architectures require a sophisticated run-time system to manage program execution and aviable resources. Additional benefits include isolated execution of untrusted code and the potential for dynamic optimisation, among others. This paper provides a high-level overview of language run-time systems with a focus on execution models, suppport for concurrency and parallelism, memory management, and comunnication, whilst briefly mentionning synchronisation, monitoring, and adaptive policy control. Two alternative approaches to run-time system design are presented and several challenges for future research are outlined. References to both seminal and recent work are provided.
