Abstract

Web content extraction is  a key technology for enabling an array of applications aimed at undertanding the web.
While automated web extraction has been studied extensively, they  often focus on extraction structed data that appear multiple times on a single webpage, like produc tcatalogs. This project aims to extract less structued web content, like news articles, that appear only once in noise webpages.  Out approach classifies text blocks using a mixture of visual a nlanguage indepedent features. In addition, a pipeline is devised to automatically label datapoitns through clustering where each cluster is scored based on its relevance to the webpage description extracted from the meta tags, an ddatapoints in the best cluster are selected as positive training examples.
