Abstract

This paper discusses modularization as a mechanism for improving the flexibility and comprehensability of a system while allowing
the shortening of its development time. THe effectiveness of a "modularization" is dependent upon the criteria used in dividing the system into modules. A system design problem is presednted and both a conventional and unconventional decompositiion are described. It is showen that the unconventional decompositions have distint advantages for the goals positions are discussed. The unconventional decomposition, if implemented with the conventional assumption that a module consists of one or more subroutines, willl be less efficient in most cases. An alternative approach to imlementation which does not have this effect is sketched.
