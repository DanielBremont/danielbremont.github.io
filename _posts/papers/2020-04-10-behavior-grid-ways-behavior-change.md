# Abstract

This paper presents a new way of categorizing behavior change in a framework called the Behavior Grid. This preliminary work shows 35 types of behavior along two categorical dimensions. To demonstrate the analytical potential for the Behavior Grid, this paper maps behavior goals from Facebook onto the framework, revealing potential patterns of intent. To show the potential for designers of persuasive technology, this paper uses the Behavior Grid to show what types of behavior change might most easily be achieved through mobile technology. The Behavior Grid needs further development, but this early version can still be useful for designers and researchers in thinking more clearly about behavior change and persuasive technology.
